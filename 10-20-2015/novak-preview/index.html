  <article class="post-content">
    <p>A few seasons ago, when Durant and the Thunder were working their way to their first Finals appearance, Steve Novak was in the Big Apple leading the league with a .472 3-point shooting percentage and throwing the Discount Double Check. Now he’s closer to the end of a stacked bench with resident sniper, Anthony Morrow, ahead of him on the depth chart. We know what Novak can bring on the court and what he cant, but there might be other ways Novak can help this team.</p>

<p>Here are a few things to look for from Novak this season:</p>

<h3 id="readiness">Readiness</h3>

<p class="tagline">Russ Isabella - USA TODAY Sports</p>

<p>Shooting is as much rhythm as anything, and sitting on a bench for the majority of a game before being asked to come in and hit big shots is a trying task for anyone. This may just be the role Coach Donovan asks Novak to play this season, and as we saw the other night against Denver this could end up with a few airballs and bricks if Novak isn’t completely dialed in. Playing time will be hard to come by on this team, so how ready will Novak be when his number is called?</p>

<h3 id="mentorship">Mentorship</h3>

<p>Steven Novak as been around the league a few times. He helped Kanter with his transition to OKC as they both departed Salt Lake City together at the trade deadline last season. He also has a very honed skill set that this Thunder team has struggled with in the pre-season: 3-point shooting. Sam Presti has a history of bringing in players that can act as mentors to the team’s younger players. Derrick Fisher, Kendrick Perkins, and Royal Ivey all spend multiple seasons on the team and left lasting impressions that have been invaluable. It’s very possible Presti sees this potential in Novak as well. He has the ability to connect with younger players as demonstrated with Enes Kanter. It also doesn’t hurt to have him around to try and smooth the waters with the Thunder’s new post-up luxury piece, who has a history of becoming disgruntled with his employer.</p>

<h3 id="extra-shooter-vs-trade-piece">Extra Shooter vs. Trade Piece</h3>

<p><img src="/content/2015-10-20/3.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" /></p>

<p class="tagline">Russ Isabella - USA TODAY Sports</p>

<p>Sam Presti likes roster flexibility. He’s put together an extremely balanced squad, but one thing is noticeably different going into this season: There’s no empty roster spot. In years past the Thunder have entered the season with a 14 man roster, usually filling it near the end of the season plugging a gap as the teams gets ready for a deep playoff run. Novak would be the 15th man on the roster, and many expected him to be traded by this point. No one knows what Presti is planning, but it may not necessarily be to use Novak as a trade piece.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, 3-point shooting is a weakness on this team outside of a few players, namely Morrow, Durant, and Ibaka. Having the ability to spread the floor and keep the defense honest with 4 or 5 shooters out on the court is the new hot thing in the NBA. Back in the 2012 Finals, Miami used this tactic to run the Thunder into the ground. Mike Miller and Shane Battier were as much to blame as Lebron in many ways, and it’s not likely Thunder brass forgot this. Having a shooter as accomplished as Novak as the 15th man on the roster could be exactly what Presti wants.</p>

<p>Steve Novak is a journeyman closer to the end of his playing career than not, but he still has things to offer. What that may end up being is up in the air as much as it is with anyone on the roster. This preseason, however, he showed what kind of shooter he still is, and as long as that remains a weakness on this team it means there could very well be a spot on the Thunder for Steve Novak to make a difference. He most likely won’t be a steady part of the rotation, but look for him to be used in spots when shots aren’t falling.</p>
