<h3 id="sacramento-kings-116---104-oklahoma-city-thunder">Sacramento Kings 116 - 104 Oklahoma City Thunder</h3>

<p>This was not a great game for the Thunder. Kevin Durant was forced to sit out with a sprained toe that gave me concern when I first heard about it - anything dealing with Kevin Durant’s feet will elicit a heart attack from yours truly. While missing the former MVP and suffering a loss at home to the Kings there were a few bright spots. First, Serge Ibaka showed up in a big way. The big man from Congo scored 25 points on 10-17 shooting. Ibaka also pulled down 7 rebounds and swatted away 5 blocks. Anthony Morrow made the most of his opportunity to start in Kevin Durant’s place. Morrow finished with 20 points on an incredibly efficient 8-11 shooting. Russell Westbrook did not have a great scoring night managing only 17 points on a less than stellar 6-23 shooting. But he did finish with a double-double dishing out 15 dimes. He came up just short in the hunt for a triple-double though as he only pulled down 8 rebounds.</p>

<p>The Kings got some really solid games from guys that have proven they can play at a high level. Boogie Cousins scored 33 points and pulled down 19 rebounds while Rajon Rondo had 13 points and a ridiculous 19 assists. Rondo also swiped 5 steals. Marco Belinelli contributed 21 points on 6-13 shooting.</p>

<h3 id="oklahoma-city-thunder-112---94-memphis-grizzlies">Oklahoma City Thunder 112 - 94 Memphis Grizzlies</h3>

<p>This game was never really that close. The Thunder pulled away early and maintained a double digit lead through most of the second half. The greatest thing about this game was that Kevin Durant showed the toe injury was a one off and that he was back. He started slowly. The star forward began the game 2-10 from the floor. He turned it around in the second half shooting 7-8 and finishing with 26 points. Durant also pulled down 17 rebounds - a season high for him. Russell Westbrook returned to form and had another near triple-double. Westbrook scored 20 points, dished out 7 assists, and grabbed 7 rebounds. Dion Waiters broke out of his slump as well scoring 15 points on 6-9 shooting in an impressive 31 minutes played. Anthony Morrow, from the bench this game, made the most of his 18 game minutes. He continued his strong shooting season going 3-4 from the floor and 6-6 from the free throw line to score 14 points - nearly a point per minute. DJ Augustin was the only DNP - Coach’s Decision for the Thunder. Even Kyle Singler and Mitch McGary saw some game action.</p>

<h1 id="trends">Trends</h1>

<h3 id="rotation">Rotation</h3>

<p>Cameron Payne continues to be Russell Westbrook’s back up at the point guard position. He has surpassed DJ Augustin. Payne brings a jolt of energy and effort on defense - two things that are hard to honestly say about Augustin at this point in the season.</p>

<h3 id="last-10">Last 10</h3>

<p>Record: 8-2
Average Points Scored: 112.2 
Average Points Allowed: 100.8</p>

<p>Forever and always, Thunder Up!</p>
