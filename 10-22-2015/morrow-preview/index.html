  <article class="post-content">
    <p>In his second season in Oklahoma City, 3-point sharpshooter Anthony Morrow will look to continue the success he saw in his first year as a member of the Thunder.</p>

<p>Morrow, arguably one of Sam Presti’s best free agent signings to date, led the Thunder in 3-pointers (141) and 3-point percentage (43 percent) last season. He averaged 10.7 points in 24.4 minutes per game.</p>

<p>Morrow has really flourished in his role with the Thunder so far, and there’s no reason to think he won’t continue his success.</p>

<p>Here are some things we’re looking for with Morrow this year.</p>

<h3 id="minutes">Minutes</h3>

<p><img src="/content/2015-10-22/Morrow 1.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" /></p>

<p class="tagline">Chris Humphreys-USA TODAY Sports</p>

<p>Given Morrow’s success last year, he should still see plenty of minutes this season, but there may be less minutes to go around.</p>

<p>A healthy Thunder will have three shooting guards, Morrow, Dion Waiters and Andre Roberson, who will likely see regular minutes. The Thunder will also probably feature a two point guard set from time to time, with Russell Westbrook and D.J. Augustin, and perhaps Cameron Payne. Kyle Singler is likely to get some minutes too, though these will most likely come from backing up Kevin Durant.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how new head coach Billy Donovan mixes and matches lineups, but hopefully the Thunder’s depth won’t keep Morrow from succeeding.</p>

<h3 id="big-games">Big Games</h3>

<p><img src="/content/2015-10-22/Morrow 2.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" /></p>

<p class="tagline">Mark D. Smith – USA TODAY Sports</p>

<p>Morrow’s always most likely to hover around 10 or 12 points per game, but last season he showed that he’s capable of getting hot and going off.</p>

<p>Morrow eclipsed 20 points six times last season, including a season high of 32 in a loss against Dallas. This isn’t the norm, but it should happen again considering the amount of open looks he should get with the Thunder’s deep offensive repertoire.</p>

<p>Morrow is always a fun player to watch, but when he gets on a roll he is virtually unstoppable. While this won’t happen every game, look for him to have some really strong performances.</p>

<h3 id="energy">Energy</h3>

<p><img src="/content/2015-10-22/Morrow 3.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" /></p>

<p class="tagline">Mark L. Baer - USA TODAY Sports</p>

<p>Morrow is one of the most energetic players in the NBA, and he is always very excited when he succeeds or sees his teammates succeed.</p>

<p>Energy isn’t something that shows up in the box score, but it contributes a lot to a team’s morale, and is great for sparking rallies. When watching Morrow, whether he’s on the court or on the bench, it’s easy to see that he loves the game and really wants his teammates to succeed. He wants to win, and he’s not afraid to show it.</p>

<p>This year’s Thunder squad should be really fun to watch, and there’s no doubt that Morrow and his energy will contribute to the entertainment.</p>

<p class="tagline">Sue Ogrocki – The Associated Press</p>

<p>Morrow had a lot of success in his first season with OKC, and this year we are hoping to see much of the same from the 3-point sniper.</p>
