    <p class="post-meta">Oct 19, 2015 • Trey</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Andre Roberson just finished his second season for the Oklahoma City Thunder. He appeared in only 67 games (starting 65) due to injury. His first season as a starter in the NBA went according to plan, sliding into the starting five after Thabo Sefolosha left for the Atlanta Hawks. He made improvements in many aspects of his game during the jump to his second year. He increased his points per game and three point shooting percentage while he saw a slight dip in field goal percentage that comes from taking more shots and playing more minutes.</p>

<p>Here are a few things we would like to see from Roberson:</p>

<h3 id="defense">Defense</h3>

<p><img src="/content/2015-10-19/roberson2.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" /></p>

<p class="tagline">Mark D. Smith – USA TODAY Sports</p>

<p>There is no question why Roberson is in the starting line up. It is his defense. He brings length and athleticism to the defensive end of the court. The 6’7” shooting guard has a 6’11” wingspan that he often uses to disrupt opposing offensive schemes. He averaged nearly one steal every game last season in just under 20 minutes per game. Roberson knows what his role on the team is: defensive stopper. It is a role that he seems perfectly content with occupying. He puts in far more effort on that end of the floor and looks more comfortable guarding the ball rather than holding it. He will continue to play that role and he will do it well.</p>

<h3 id="slashing--finishing">Slashing / Finishing</h3>

<p><img src="/content/2015-10-19/roberson3.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" /></p>

<p class="tagline">NBC Sports</p>

<p>Roberson has shown regularly that he has the ability to finish around the rim. He does not regularly influence on the offensive end of the court, but he does, however, have the ability to slash to the basket when the opportunity presents itself. Roberson will not create often for himself, but he excels when the ball is passed around the perimeter and opposing defenders get lost or are constantly shifting. It creates lanes and openings for him to get into the paint. Motion and spacing is a key part of Coach Donovan’s new offense, which could pay dividends for Roberson this season.</p>

<h3 id="point-shooting">3-Point Shooting</h3>

<p><img src="/content/2015-10-19/roberson4.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" /></p>

<p class="tagline">Gary A. Vasquez – USA Today Sports</p>

<p>This is the biggest area of improvement that we need to see from Roberson. Last season he shot only 24.7% from beyond the arc. In order for Roberson to fulfill his potential and really help this team out then he needs to increase that percentage. Nobody is expecting Roberson to shoot 40% from deep and score double digit points every night, but if he could raise the three point shooting percentage to just 30% or slightly higher then he will help the team even more than he already does. Roberson has shown he has the ability, but comfindence may be the key to his improvement. His 3-point shot dropped over 30 percentage points when simply comparing away versus home games, where he only made one 3-pointer all season. If he improves this will open the court up more for other players as well as himself. When defenders are forced to cover the 3-point line Roberson will be able to attack the paint and show off his finishing ability.</p>

<p class="tagline">Andre Roberson - Twitter (@FlyDre21)</p>

<p>Andre Roberson is a perfect fit for this roster, particularly considering the rest of the options at shooting guard. With Anthony Morrow and Dion Waiters playing behind Roberson there is a lot of offense. Roberson counters their skillset with a defensive centered one. He will continue to be an important part of the OKC Thunder. In his third year in the NBA he will continue to grow and improve.</p>
