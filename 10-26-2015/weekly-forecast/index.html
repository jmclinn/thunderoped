    <h1 id="games">Games</h1>

<h3 id="wednesday-october-28-at-700-pm-cst--vs-san-antonio-spurs">Wednesday, October 28 at 7:00 PM CST – vs. San Antonio Spurs</h3>

<p>The Thunder will start the season with a tough home game against the ever-dangerous Spurs. There are plenty of storylines to watch in this game: Kevin Durant’s return, LaMarcus Aldridge’s Spurs debut, and legendary coach Gregg Popovich vs. rookie Billy Donovan. The Thunder would love to start the season with a big victory, and this game should prove to be a great one.</p>

<h3 id="friday-october-30-at-600-pm-cst--at-orlando-magic">Friday, October 30 at 6:00 PM CST – at Orlando Magic</h3>

<p>Game two comes on the road against the Magic, a young team with a lot of talent in guys like Victor Oladipo and Nikola Vucevic. This Magic team is no slouch, but the Thunder should be able to overpower them and take a victory on the road.</p>

<h3 id="sunday-november-1-at-600-pm-cst--vs-denver-nuggets">Sunday, November 1 at 6:00 PM CST – vs. Denver Nuggets</h3>

<p>The Thunder’s final game of the week falls on Sunday, against Denver. The Nuggets are not likely to be very good this year, and new head coach Mike Malone certainly has his work cut out for him. This game should be a pretty easy victory for the Thunder.</p>

<h1 id="three-things-to-watch-for">Three Things to Watch for:</h1>

<h3 id="the-return-of-kevin-durant">The Return of Kevin Durant:</h3>
<p>Who hasn’t been looking forward to this since April? Durant is coming off a season ruined by his foot injury, and will look to bounce back to his 2013-14 MVP form. Everyone is nervous that his foot problems will linger, but fans have a reason to be optimistic after watching him play like the Durant we know and love in the preseason. So long as he is healthy, Durant should have no problems returning to dominance.</p>

<h3 id="billy-donovan">Billy Donovan:</h3>
<p>The Thunder’s new coach will begin the season with high expectations. Scott Brooks was fired at the end of last season, following the Thunder’s first time missing the playoffs since the 2008-09 season. Brooks was unable to get the Thunder over the hump and win a championship, and the Thunder decided to gamble on a rookie coach in Donovan. He had plenty of success coaching at the University of Florida, and is highly regarded, so the hope is certainly that he can take the Thunder to the next level.</p>

<h3 id="offense-vs-defense">Offense vs. Defense:</h3>
<p>There seems to be no question that the Thunder offense should be deadly, with the likes of Durant, Russell Westbrook, Enes Kanter, Serge Ibaka, Dion Waiters and Anthony Morrow all available as scoring options. The questions, however, lie on defense. The Thunder have some great defensive players like Ibaka, Steven Adams and Andre Roberson, but on the other hand they have guys like Kanter and Morrow, who struggle on the defensive end. The first unit defense should be good, but a second unit that features both Kanter and Morrow may struggle on that front. It’s certainly something to look out for as the Thunder opens the season.</p>

<h1 id="around-the-league">Around the League:</h1>

<p>Here are some games around the NBA to watch for this week.</p>

<h3 id="cleveland-cavaliers-at-chicago-bulls--tuesday-october-27-at-700-pm-cst">Cleveland Cavaliers at Chicago Bulls – Tuesday, October 27 at 7:00 PM CST</h3>

<p>This is one of two games that will kick off the two 2014-15 season, and is quite possibly an Easter Conference Finals matchup preview. It’s certainly early to call something like that, but both of these teams should be very good this year, and this game will be a good one.</p>

<h3 id="dallas-mavericks-at-los-angeles-clippers--thursday-october-29-at-930-pm-cst">Dallas Mavericks at Los Angeles Clippers – Thursday, October 29 at 9:30 PM CST</h3>

<p>Who doesn’t love some NBA drama? Clippers center DeAndre Jordan bailed on his Dallas contract this offseason, and luckily for NBA fans, they are set to meet in week one. The Clippers are no doubt better than Dallas, and should win, but the drama behind this matchup should make it entertaining.</p>

<h3 id="golden-state-warriors-at-houston-rockets--friday-october-30-at-830-pm-cst">Golden State Warriors at Houston Rockets – Friday, October 30 at 8:30 PM CST</h3>

<p>The reigning champs with their MVP Steph Curry will take on MVP runner up James Harden’s Rockets. Both of these teams are title contenders this year, and this game should be fantastic.</p>

<h1 id="by-the-numbers">By the Numbers:</h1>

<h3 id="section">10.2</h3>
<p>Amount of rebounds Ibaka has averaged against the Spurs in his career. It’s the only team he’s averaged double-digit boards against.</p>

<h3 id="section-1">502</h3>
<p>Amount of college wins for Coach Donovan. He’ll hope to continue his success in the NBA.</p>

<h3 id="section-2">18.1</h3>
<p>Dion Waiters’ career points per game against Orlando, the most he’s averaged against any team. He’s also shot 47 percent against the Magic.</p>
