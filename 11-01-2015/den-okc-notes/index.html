<p>OKC needed a statement win, if not for rest purposes then to convince themselves they could shut down another team defensively from the tip. They got that win against Denver.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Those orange uniforms. The look really good on the court.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The defensive effort was so obviously better from the tip. It was also leading to transition points we’re used to seeing from this team, which is a good sign.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Serge Ibaka was all over this game. Powering inside, making his shots, and most importantly making his presence felt defensively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ibaka’s chase down blocks were back. He looked back in rhythm for really the first time this season. He’s been making his shots all three games, and had some good defensive stops, but in terms of an overall game Serge finally looked like himself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was prematurely worried about Ibaka’s shot blocking. Not anymore. He had five blocks, and sat the entire 4th quarter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I like the idea of Roberson starting, but his shooting consistency has not improved at all. After two bad shots and a lot of hesitations I started to wonder how long of a leash he has. He was pulled early in favor of Waiters, which seems to be Donovan’s preferred method of feeling out a game: start with your defensive starter that you know can’t shoot, and if he’s giving you nothing then sit him.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That being said, Roberson worked to earn his minutes as the game progressed. Defense to offense was a big part of the Thunder’s success against the Nuggets, and Roberson was hounding. He never takes plays off, and if he can move well off the ball to help the motion of the offense keep flowing he can still be effective enough at times where his defense will keep him on the floor. To be noted: as I took these notes on Roberson he nailed a 3-pointer to shut me up. He was all by himself in the corner, but it’s a start.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think Malone has a shot to make this Denver team overperform this season. They lack a lot of talent and have some injury problems, but Emmanuel Mudiay is a Rookie of the Year candidate, and that can’t hurt.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Thunder in transition is so scary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When Harden was on this team, it added another player who was deadly on the break. Thabo Sefolosha was also good in transition. Neither are on the team anymore, but Waiters has a chance to help bring another look outside of Westbrook and Durant when running the floor. His passing and newfound ability to finish at the rim could help the Thunder’s transition offense.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nick Collison didn’t play last game despite the desperate need for defense. Against Denver he came in at the end of the 1st quarter and had his typical solid minutes. I’m still trying to figure out what Donovan sees as Collison’s role and strengths. When the Thunder are getting broken down inside doesn’t he give them an advantage, more so than with a transition happy, 3-point shooting team? It’ll be intersting to see how Collison’s minutes come moving forward.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Kyle Singler is a foul machine. He had a great defensive stop and strip (block?) and then followed it up with a 3-pointer at the other end for a strong start to the 2nd quarter. Too bad he picked up three quick fouls and had to sit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3-point defense? I thought that was going to be a focus comng into the season. Randy Foye got was too many open looks for Denver. I suspect Coach Donovan isn’t too happy about that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking of focuses, wasn’t there supposed to be something about flopping in this league? I vaguely remember that. Seeing Danilo Gallinari reminds me of this everytime I see him.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Augustin has not had a bad game. He shot <strong>extremely</strong> well, and continued to set up his teammates without turning the ball over. He continues to be very solid. Great pick up at the trade deadline, and maybe as important for this team as Enes Kanter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Kanter didn’t see much of the court until garbage time (where he managed to pull off a double-double). It’s still so interesting learning who Donovan puts on the floor depending on who the opponent is and what is needed at that time. Scott Brooks achieved this through certain set lineups, which led to the perception that he was too stubborn and inflexible. Donovan seems to prefer subbing in one or two players at a time for more fluid adjustments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Thunder’s offense is working you don’t even notice it. There were 32 assists against the Nuggets, including four from Ibaka, which just seemed natural. The comfort level is rising with the new offensive sets, and that 2OT finish agaisnt the Magic seems to have done more good than just put Durant back in his rhythm. There were still the turnover issues, but things are smoothing out quickly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cameron Payne and Mitch McGary, a.k.a Campayne and McGOAT, saw their first minutes tonight. Payne had a nice steak and three good assists. He didn’t seem to have any rookie jitters or force anything to prove a point in the 4:30 garbage minutes he was given. McGary seemed a bit rusty. Hopefully he can shake the slight setback from his concussion quickly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Good rest for the starters, sitting the entire 4th quarter, before heading to Houston without a day off.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="eyeball-test">Eyeball Test?</h1>

<p><strong>Confident and comfortable.</strong> 30+ assists could be something we see regularly, and it seemed so natural. The defense stole the show and brought back the deadly transition offense this team is known for. It was also good to have Ibaka back to himself.</p>
