    <h3 id="tor-103---okc-98">TOR 103 - OKC 98</h3>

<p>Turnovers destroyed the Thunder again tonight. It has been a common trope for Oklahoma City already this season. There is a learning curve when it comes to implementing a new offense, but after a full offseason, and now 5 games into the season there should be improvement. Unfortunately, when it comes to ball security there hasn’t been any improvement.</p>

<p>The Thunder started the game out hot. They scored 23 in the first quarter while holding the Raptors to just 13. Kevin Durant went 3-6 to start and Russell Westbrook racked up 8 assists in the opening quarter.</p>

<p>The wheels fell off the bus in the second quarter though, and the roles got reversed. The Raptors put up 27 in the second quarter. Toronto only shot 44.4% in the quarter, but they got to the charity stripe 10 times, converting 9, compared to Oklahoma City’s just 2 trips.</p>

<p>With both teams having a successful offensive and defensive quarter in the first half, the third quarter was an offensive explosion. Oklahoma City put up 42 points in the quarter and Toronto put in 33. Russell Westbrook had 16 points and 5 assists in the quarter. Kevin Durant scored another 11 points in the quarter. The team shot an outstanding 72.7% from the floor including 6/9 from deep. The biggest difference in this quarter was the turnovers. The team limited the freebies to just two.</p>

<p>The fourth quarter was borderline atrocious for Oklahoma City. The Thunder shot just 25% from the field and went 1/6 from the arc. Toronto took advantage of the poor shooting performance and closed the gap over the quarter, ultimately surpassing and defeating the Thunder. The Raptors fourth quarter was efficient. The team shot 50% from the floor and made 13 trips to the free throw line knocking down 11 of the attempts. The fourth quarter was a bit of an enigma when someone looks at the minutes. Dion Waiters played all twelve minutes of the quarter while Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant played just 7:29 each.</p>

<p>The biggest take away from this game is that there is a pattern emerging. The Thunder still haven’t figured out late game execution. The offense became stagnant down the stretch. Instead of relying on the offense which saw Russell Westbrook hand out 15 assists in the first 3 quarters, the team began relying on one on one isolation plays again. The Scotty Brooks comparisons will now be prevalent for Billy Donovan until a successful late game offense emerges.</p>

<p>The Thunder lost the lead inside of a minute left in the game. Kevin Durant took a turnaround fade away 14 foot jumper. Toronto rebounded the miss and Demar DeRozan converted a layup to put the Raptors up. Maybe the hardest part of the fourth quarter was when a jump ball came with 11 seconds left on the Thunder offensive end. Durant missed the back end free throw which Toronto rebounded. Westbrook made a hustle play and knocked the ball loose and Serge Ibaka jumped on the ball to tie it up. Ibaka should have won the tip, but miss-timed his jump essentially sealing the game for the Raptors.</p>

<p>Ibaka had an efficient night scoring 10 points on 4/7 shooting and pulled down 6 rebounds. Unfortunately that is not the stat line of a player that Westbrook and Durant rely on as a safety valve to relieve pressure. Enes Kanter continued to impress though. He finished with 15 points on 7/11 shooting and pulled down 6 rebounds.</p>

<p>The Thunder are still working on settling into the new system and new coach. Growing pains are expected when there are changes like these. Donovan is still adjusting to the NBA and his players are still adjusting to the new leadership at the top. The season is young and this team is going to be crazy good once they limit the turnovers.</p>
