  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Everybody in the world knows that Kevin Durant is going to be a free agent this summer. The NBA knows it. NBA fans know it. Oklahoma City knows it. Yet, the continual media fascination with his impending free agency is amazing.</p>

<p>Kevin Durant recently said that the Washington Wizards fans openly recruiting him during games when Oklahoma City - his current team, don’t forget - travels to the east coast. Yes, Durant is from DC and he loves his home town. Yes, he can choose to play anywhere in the world he wants next season. The media is so dead set on Durant being Lebron James and returning home that they can’t get out of their own way when discussing it.</p>

<p>Today on PTI Tony Kornheiser and Michael Wilbon addressed Durant’s homegoing. Two days after he said the Wizards fans were being disrespectful to their own team by openly lobbying another player to come to the city A YEAR FROM NOW, Wilbon stated that he wasn’t sure what Durant was doing. A man who always discusses his unfettered access to the biggest and best players in the NBA said that he couldn’t tell which way Durant was leaning. Did that stop him from giving his thoughts anyway? No. He did say, however, that Durant keeping DC at arm’s length may be an attempt to lessen the blow if he decides not to return home. He said it’s difficult to go home. Yes. Yes it is. Not everybody is Lebron James, sure. What he failed to mention was that Kevin Durant is still playing in Oklahoma City. Maybe he was doing it because he actually likes this little part of the MidSouthWest.</p>

<p>Kornheiser went on to say that Durant should re-sign for one year in Oklahoma City and then leave for the Los Angeles Lakers with Russell Westbrook during the summer of 2017.</p>

<p>Nobody is giving Oklahoma City a chance. Yes - we are a small market. We are not LA, DC, or New York. We never will be. We don’t want to be. We don’t have the big fancy nightclubs where there’s a new celebrity leaving for rehab the next day. But what we do have is a loyal fanbase. This city supported a 1-12 team in its first year and has not looked back sense. We know how lucky we are to have Durant and Westbrook. Sure, if you want to play in a city of 10+ million people, this isn’t your place. But if you want to play in front of a great fanbase who will show up every single night and yell loudly, then this is your place. If you want to be showered with constant praise, this is your place.</p>

<p>Forever and always, Thunder Up!</p>
