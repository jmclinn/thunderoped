<p>In a game mostly controlled by the San Antonio Spurs, the Thunder was able to come out on top in the end.</p>

<p>Like most matchups between these two teams, the game stayed pretty close throughout, though it seemed as though the Spurs were in control for the majority of the game.</p>

<p>The Thunder got off to a rough start offensively, while the Spurs settled into an early rhythm. The Thunder was getting a lot of open looks, but early on they were not falling. However, thanks to Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant, who combined for 18 first quarter points, the Thunder lead 29-27 at the end of the quarter.</p>

<p>The second quarter was the Thunder’s worst quarter, and it was during this quarter that the Spurs really seemed in control. They did this with great defense, forcing 11 turnovers and only sending the Thunder to the free throw line for three attempts.</p>

<p>Though the Thunder struggled in the second quarter, there were some bright spots in D.J. Augustin, Dion Waiters and Enes Kanter, who all played well in their first half minutes. Augustin and Waiters were both making smart decisions and Kanter was a beast on the glass as usual, tallying six points and eight rebounds in the first half.</p>

<p>Though the Spurs defense was solid in the first half, the Thunder still shot 50 percent, though they were just 3-11 from beyond the arc. After one half the Thunder were down 55-50.</p>

<p>The third quarter featured both teams trading runs for the bulk of the quarter, with Westbrook carrying the Thunder, while Durant’s offense sputtered due to some tough defense from Kawhi Leonard.</p>

<p>Kanter continued his success in the third, reaching the double-double plateau after playing just 17 minutes. Ibaka, who struggled in the first half, found some rhythm in the third quarter as well.</p>

<p>The Thunder would eventually win the third quarter by a point, making the score 83-79 in favor of the Spurs after three.</p>

<p>The Spurs controlled the fourth quarter for a while, but the Thunder was able to hang around due to some timely buckets by Westbrook, Kanter, Anthony Morrow and Steven Adams.</p>

<p>At around the four-minute mark the Thunder seemed to be taking control of the game, and though it would remain close until the end, the Thunder would not be held back. Waiters hit two big jumpers late, and Westbrook added a huge clutch three.</p>

<p>However, after a Leonard and-1 the Spurs were down by just two. They got the ball back with about 20 second remaining, but Danny Green launched an ill-advised prayer, giving the Thunder the chance to put the game away.</p>

<p>The Thunder would hit the late game free throws to finish the game off, and won with a final score of 112-106.</p>

<p>Durant scored 22 but struggled most of the game, and was noticeably outmatched by Leonard. He got a lot of good looks but never found a consistent stroke.</p>

<p>Westbrook finished with 33 points and 10 assists and Kanter finished with an impressive double-double of 15 points and 16 rebounds. The rest of the scoring was refreshingly balanced, with four more guys with eight points or more.</p>

<p>The Thunder will hope to carry some momentum from this big win into its Friday night matchup with the Orlando Magic.</p>
