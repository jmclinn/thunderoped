        </h2>
		  <p>Mitch McGary is entering his sophomore season in the NBA and will look to avoid a sophomore slump. He performed well in limited minutes and quickly became a fan favorite last season. His hustle is inspiring to anybody who has ever wanted to achieve a single thing in their life. The man is nothing short of a spark plug and does a lot of things effectively, and anything he cannot do he will attempt with full vigor...</p>

        </h2>
		  <p>Last season was huge for Russell Westbrook. It was his first (and hopefully last) season being the only superstar on a team. He showed the world he is more than capable of carrying an NBA team on his shoulders. With an injury depleted roster, he took the Thunder to the brink of the playoffs...</p>

		  <p>There were some huge changes this offseason that will have profound impacts on the future of basketball in Oklahoma City. There were changes at the top of the coaching staff along with an unfortunate amount of physical therapy and surgeries.
