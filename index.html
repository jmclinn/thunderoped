		  <p>After the 2012-13 season there were no mysteries about what type of player the Thunder were going to draft. They had the 12th pick and they needed a big man. OKC fans were in the midst of screaming for Perkins' head, and no matter whether Presti listened or not (he didn't) there was no hiding the inevitable: Perkins was overpriced and didn't have any knees left. The Thunder needed a center for the future who could learn from Perk before he left town and who could dole out the same type of punishments. Enter Adams and his bone-crushing screens...</p>

Kanter became a member of the thunder after Sam Presti pulled the trigger on a blockbuster deal that also landed the Thunder D.J, Augustin, Kyle Singler and Steve Novak. He jumped right into his new role in Oklahoma City, and now is here to stay after signing a monster 4-year contract...</p>
