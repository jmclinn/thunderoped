<p>No TV broadcast, but a complimentary online stream? Sounds good to me.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The beginning of the game showed great movement and more comfort from the starters. Lots of Adams (even though he was still struggling to catch Westbrook passes at the beginning of the game), including a beautiful find of a cutting Westbrook.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Durant is back boys and girls. He struggled at the beginning of the Mavericks game last Tuesday, but he was in rhythm and looked very comfortable to start tonight: cutting, passing, crossing over defenders, nailing a straight-away three pointer, and initiating contact to get to the line.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against the Mavs the Thunder looked like they were thinking about their movements. Those movements appeared much more natural tonight, which bodes well for early season success as they continue to learn Donovan’s system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preseason prediction: Emmanuel Mudiay wins Rookie of the Year (and the Lakers punch themselves in the face).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preseason prediction #2: Ibaka’s offensive numbers increase. He hit multiple floaters within just a few feet of the basket in the first quarter, catching the ball several feet closer than the 18-19 foot sweet spot he’s perfected over the years.  Ibaka’s offense has never been dependent on plays drawn up for him, instead relying on hitting his spots. If his ‘spots’ are closer to the basket under Donovan that’s good for Ibaka and the Thunder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Kanter hustle defense caused a travel? Good sign. He also had 6 fouls, which I’ll take as another good sign based on defensive effort alone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Kanter wants his. If he’s within 20 feet the ball stops with him. He’s very talented, and when he has the ball it’s usually very close to the basket which is more often than not a big plus. It’s something to watch, however, because even if he doesn’t care that he’s the sixth or seventh man I wouldn’t call him selfless.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe it’s a bad snap judgement to make without a larger sample size, or any regular season action, but I wouldn’t have many (any?) reservations to Presti signing Waiters to an extension before the Nov. 2nd deadline.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lots of turnovers, but Westbrook threw a decent number of cross court prayers over multiple defenders that didn’t go his way. He always has and always will take chances, but I have a feeling the nature of regular season games actually counting will reduce some of these turnovers. That’s the hope at least.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Coach Billy Donovan said realistic rotations would start to make an appearance the final two preseason games. Compared to the bulk substitutions we’ve seen until this point, it was interesting to see who was first to replace who. Kyle Singler came in for Roberson after he picked up two fouls, and later Waiters was brought in to replace Durant. Despite the guard/forward position switch, with Singler at the 2 and Waiters at the 3, based on their styles of play these substitutions make a lot of sense. Singler seems a much closer Roberson replacement, and Waiters helps spell some of the scoring and playmaking drop-off when Durant goes to the bench.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When Westbrook is guarding Danilo Gallinari and the Italian goes flying, did Gallinari just fall down or did Westbrook simply throw him aside? Either is totally plausible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three point shooting remains a struggle. Even the team’s resident shooters struggled mightily. Morrow couldn’t find his range and Novak even air-balled a three. Waiter’s however? two of four from deep.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Watching this game on the Thunder’s online stream means I had no idea the score. I would have never guessed the game was as close as it was in the third quarter, but the Nuggets were allowed quite a few threes. Old habits die hard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mudiay is good. Durant is better. He’s definitely back and that is very, very good to see. The Westbrook triple-double machine we became acquainted with last season also continues to be on display. The heads of the hydra now know their individual potentials, and working together doesn’t seem to be reducing that in any way. This season is going to be fun.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Injuries: Kanter is back and looked good. McGary has a concussion, and Adams got knocked out with an eye injury after a powerful first half. Hopefully the Thunder’s deep big man rotation can get healthy soon.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="eyeball-test">Eyeball Test?</h4>

<p><strong>Comfortable.</strong> Where they go, and how they fit is sinking in. Defense can always use work, but Durant looks better and better as the Thunder move closer to their season tipoff hosting the Spurs.</p>
