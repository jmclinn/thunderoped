<p>The Thunder ended the first (and hopefully only) losing streak of the season. It was another Sunset Sunday with the Thunder wearing the new Sunday alternates. Oklahoma City put together a full game for the first time this season, winning three quarters and tying one.</p>

<p>The Thunder came out blazing in the first quarter pushing the lead to 15 points before the second unit allowed the lead to slip. The starters combined for 19 points on 9-of-16 shooting while the second unit went just 3-of-9 for 8 points. Kevin Durant got hot immediately shooting 3-of-4 and scoring 8 in the quarter while Russell Westbrook went 3-of-6 for 6 points and added 6 assists as well. Eric Bledsoe had a huge quarter for the Suns making 6-of-7 from the floor and scoring 15 in the first frame.</p>

<p>The second quarter saw the return of the first unit and a win for the quarter – outscoring Phoenix 31-25. Dion Waiters got things turned around shooting a perfect 3-of-3 from the field, and 4-of-4 from the charity stripe to score 10 in the quarter. The Thunder went into halftime leading 60-54.</p>

<p>The second half was the big difference for the Thunder. They extended the lead to double digits again in the third quarter. The starters played significant minutes coming out of halftime, with the exception of Steven Adams who logged only 4:21 in the third with Enes Kanter relieving him.</p>

<p>The final quarter saw the Thunder push the lead to the eventual blowout that the game became. The bench was seen as a strength for the Thunder coming in to the season but it has been disappointing compared to the hype it received as possibly being the deepest team assembled in Oklahoma City. The second unit redeemed itself in the fourth quarter though. In the final quarter the reserves combined to go 8-of-11 for 20 points.</p>

<p>In just six minutes, Kevin Durant had a perfect quarter going 5-of-5 from the field (including a made three) for 11 points in just 6:34. Kanter tied Durant for leading scorer of the quarter shooting an efficient 5-of-5 and converting his only free throw after an a foul and made basket. Dion Waiters, not to be left out, joined the perfect quarter club and finished the quarter with 5 points on 2-of-2 shooting, including a basket from behind the arc.</p>

<p>Kevin Durant lead all scorers with a quiet 32 points on 12-of-19 shooting. He completed the double-double by pulling down 11 boards as well. Russell Westbrook joined Kevin Durant in the double-double club scoring 21 points on 9-of-20 shooting and dishing out 13 assists. It was his fourth game in a row with a double-double and his fifth overall on the season. Enes Kanter and Dion Waiters joined in the scoring fun from the bench. Kanter finished with 21 points while shooting 90 percent from the floor (9/10) and converting all 3 of his free throw attempts. He pulled down 7 rebounds too. Waiters pitched in 19 points on an efficient 6-of-9 shooting and forced 3 turnovers, reaching into the cookie jar for 3 steals.</p>

<p>Thunder fans continue to be baffled by Anthony Morrow’s absence from the rotation. He logged his first DNP-Coach’s Decision of the season, joining Nick Collison as the only players to leave their warmups on all game. Coach Billy Donovan attributed it to the matchups, though Morrow has not seen significant minutes the last 4 games. He failed to score in all 4 games in very playing time.</p>

<p>The Thunder take on the Washington Wizards in a homecoming game for Kevin Durant on Tuesday, November 10th. The game will be carried by NBATV and Fox Sports Oklahoma with tipoff occurring at 6 pm Central Standard Time. Kevin Durant recently stated that the Washington fans openly attempting to court him before his looming free agency was “disrespectful” to the team they currently have. It should prove to be an interesting game. It could also be Billy Donovan’s first game against Bradley Beal who played for Donovan at Florida before leaving for the NBA. Beal is listed as questionable for the game.</p>
