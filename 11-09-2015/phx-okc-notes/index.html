<p>The Thunder haven’t lost to the Suns at home for a few seasons, and they were able to keep that streak alive with a very solid victory Sunday night.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The start looked good yet again. Solid defense and movement on offense, just like the Thunder have started the last few games. The question was whether it could last or not.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Westbrook had two steals early in the first quarter, cheating off his man and sneaking around behind the ball handler to grab it away for fast break opportunities. As the game went on Westbrook kept trying for steals, often letting his man blow by him to try and poke it away from behind. Gambling from Westbrook can lead to those explosive, sometimes game changing plays, but there’s a nice balance to be had.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ibaka and Kanter fought over a rebound again this game, turning it over. This is the dumbest kind of turnover, but those two may average one a game this season.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first few games Donovan seemed to be substituting out his lineups gradually, but more recently he’s been doing wholesale changes sitting the starters in bulk near the end of the first quarter. It hasn’t gone well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great start to the game was completely negated by the bench. It was a collapse that has seen the Thunder spiral in several games. The double digit lead was completely erased, leaving the game tied heading into the second quarter. The turnover bug seemed to be about to strike again and Phoenix was blowing by the Thunder on defense. There’s too much talent on this bench for it to be this bad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe stagger KD and Russ’ minutes early in the game if the bench can’t get into rhythm fast enough to stay off major losses in points?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Singler replaced Durant yet again. I think I almost understand why it theoretically makes sense, maybe. Waiters is already on the floor at this point, replacing Roberson as the first substitution. Waiters and Durant make the most logical 1-to-1 replacement, with ball-handling, scoring, and passing abilities. With Waiters already on the floor, however, Singler is the go to small forward replacement. However, when Durant sits why not just switch Waiters onto the opposing team’s 3? He has the size, and it would allow Donovan to bring in another guard (Morrow?) off the bench.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mitch McGary sighting early, and his struggles continued. Can’t get much floor time or get in rhythm when committing three fouls nearly instantly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Waiters stepped it up big time in the second quarter. He was the only bench production, and things really seemed to open up for him when Ibaka, and then Adams, checked back in to get some defensive stops, space the floor, and open Waiters up with good screens. The bench by itself wasn’t giving enough help to help Waiters get going.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems like the Thunder have collapsed in the latter half of the first quarter in multiple (if not most) games this season. The chemistry has been lacking when the bench takes over, and it doesn’t seem to regain a foothold until the starters have taken back over halfway through the second. It’s set up some very positive third quarters, but the team has lost big leads and good momentum in that late 1st, early 2nd chunk of the game. Against good teams this puts the Thunder in a hole early, and when Westbrook and Durant feel the pressure the chance of hero, iso ball gets a lot bigger. It’s happened three times already this season, and when the wheels fell off the bus they were never put back on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>McGary checked back into the game in the third quarter. He was getting torched by Markieff Morris, but he started to calm down in general and added his energy. The bench activity was significantly elevated from the first quarter. It was an overall effort, but McGary will always bring energy. There’s a chance Donovan put him into the rotation, despite his obvious struggles, against Phoenix to try and force him to get going so that he can be a spark ready to go whenever it’s needed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bench was able to maintain the lead and positive play leading into the fourth. The injection of the skill and energy of Westbrook and Durant midway through absolutely killed Phoenix. The pressure was off with a decent lead to begin with, and the ball movement from the start of the game continued. Late in games the two superstars have had isolation tendencies, especially when the game is close. This is a major step forward in terms of late-game execution, but will it hold up when the pressure mounts? It’s at least a start in the right direction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ibaka seemed a step behind all night, and has for a good portion of these first seven games. I hate to even think about worrying if he’s lost a step defensively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Post game Donovan discussed ‘established players’ being professional and understanding that it’s a big picture where new guys need the opportunity to get comfortable so they can better contribute in the long run. He was talking about Collison, but it could also have shed some light on the Morrow/Singler minutes discrepancy. Everyone knows what Morrow brings, and Singler has been absolutely terrible since arriving in OKC. Maybe Donovan is desperately trying to get Singler going before utilizing a more balanced approach between those two players. This would make the most practical sense in the minutes that almost seem force-fed to Singler.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="eyeball-test">Eyeball Test?</h1>

<p><strong>Comfortable and collected.</strong> They shouldn’t have lost, and they didn’t. The good parts got better, and the turnovers and late game execution troubles are definitely on positive upswings. The bench is still unpredictable, however, and needs to be at least consistent for this team to make the dent in the West that its capable of making.</p>
