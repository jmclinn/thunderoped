    <h1 id="games">Games</h1>

<h3 id="monday-november-2-at-700-pm-cst--at-houston-rockets">Monday, November 2 at 7:00 PM CST – at Houston Rockets</h3>

<p>The Thunder opens the week against a struggling Rockets team that has lost each of its three games by 20 points. The Rockets have a great team and are certainly due to play more in line with their potential, so the Thunder can’t come into this game expecting an easy victory. They should look to get up early and stay up throughout.</p>

<h3 id="wednesday-november-4-at-700-pm-cst--vs-toronto-raptors">Wednesday, November 4 at 7:00 PM CST – vs. Toronto Raptors</h3>

<p>The Raptors begin the week as one of just two undefeated Eastern Conference teams, playing well behind guys like Kyle Lowry, DeMar DeRozan and Jonas Valanciunas. The Raptors, like the Thunder, hold a deep roster with some dangerous players. The Thunder will have to play a strong game on both sides of the court to hold off their northern foes.</p>

<h3 id="thursday-november-5-at-700-pm-cst--at-chicago-bulls">Thursday, November 5 at 7:00 PM CST – at Chicago Bulls</h3>

<p>Depending on how the Rockets game goes, this may be the toughest matchup for the Thunder this week. The Bulls have a really strong team with guys like Jimmy Butler, Derrick Rose and Pau Gasol, and they’re regarded as one of the favorites in the East this year. This one won’t be easy, especially on the road.</p>

<h3 id="sunday-november-8-at-600-pm-cst--vs-phoenix-suns">Sunday, November 8 at 6:00 PM CST – vs. Phoenix Suns</h3>

<p>The Suns are 2-1 so far this season, but both wins came against a young and depleted Portland Trailblazers team. That being said, the Suns are certainly not a team that can be ignored, especially when their team features Eric Bledsoe and Brandon Knight, one of the better guard combos in the league. The Thunder will take Phoenix on after two days of rest, so here’s hoping fresh legs leads to a Thunder victory.</p>

<h1 id="three-things-to-watch-for">Three Things to Watch for:</h1>

<h3 id="point-guard-matchups">Point Guard Matchups:</h3>

<p>The NBA has reached a point where point guard is arguably its strongest position, and the Thunder will bear witness to that this week. Thunder superstar Russell Westbrook will matchup against Ty Lawson, Kyle Lowry, Derrick Rose and Eric Bledsoe this week. These are all tough matchups in which Westbrook will have a lot of work to do on both sides of the court. Keep in mind also that Bledsoe is possibly the strongest defender of Westbrook in the league. Either way, the Thunder point guard is in for a tough week.</p>

<h3 id="fatigue">Fatigue:</h3>

<p>Including Sunday night’s victory against Denver, the Thunder is in the midst of a four game in five days stretch. The Thunder’s roster in extremely deep this year, and probably more so than it’s ever been, but that many games in five days is tough for any team. Hopefully the Thunder can get some big leads late like they did against the Nuggets, allowing the starters some much needed rest.</p>

<h3 id="defense">Defense:</h3>

<p>The Thunder defense has allowed just under 112 points per game so far this season. Though it’s just been three games, and that number is inflated by the double overtime thriller against Orlando, the defense has left a lot to be desired. The good news so far is that the offense has been strong enough to allow the Thunder to come out on top, but this won’t likely always be the case. This defense needs to improve as soon as possible, and look for Billy Donovan and co. to start making some adjustments to enhance the team’s performance on that side of the court.</p>

<h1 id="around-the-league">Around the League:</h1>

<p>Here are some games around the NBA to watch for this week.</p>

<h3 id="memphis-grizzlies-at-golden-state-warriors--monday-november-2-at-930-pm-cst">Memphis Grizzlies at Golden State Warriors – Monday, November 2 at 9:30 PM CST</h3>

<p>The Western Conference is as deep as ever, and for that reason there’s typically at least one conference matchup per night that is worth a watch. The Warriors have started strong behind MVP Steph Curry, and are looking to build a repeat championship campaign. The Grizzlies are in the Western Conference conversation yet again this year as well, and this game surely won’t disappoint.</p>

<h3 id="new-york-knicks-at-cleveland-cavaliers--wednesday-november-4-at-700-pm-cst">New York Knicks at Cleveland Cavaliers – Wednesday, November 4 at 7:00 PM CST</h3>

<p>Two years ago a game between these two teams wouldn’t be worth the two plus hours of your life, but this year is different. The Cavs are obviously a force to be reckoned with and the Knicks put together a solid team behind Carmelo Anthony this season. Plus there’s the whole Melo vs. LeBron rivalry that’s existed since they came into the league the same year. This should be fun to watch.</p>

<h3 id="los-angeles-clippers-at-golden-state-warriors--wednesday-november-4-at-930-pm-cst">Los Angeles Clippers at Golden State Warriors – Wednesday, November 4 at 9:30 PM CST</h3>

<p>These two teams both enter the week undefeated, and they’ve looked good. They also have some history from the playoffs that has turned their matchup into one that’s always fun too watch. Both teams feature deep rosters behind some of the league’s top stars, so this game is sure to be a great one.</p>

<h1 id="by-the-numbers">By the Numbers:</h1>

<h3 id="section">9</h3>

<p>The number of games it took the Thunder to reach three wins last season, with win number four coming in the sixteenth game. Nice to have that season behind us, eh?</p>

<h3 id="section-1">3</h3>

<p>Number of three pointers James Harden has made in his first three games, in 32 attempts. That’s good for about nine percent from beyond the arc.</p>

<h3 id="section-2">62</h3>

<p>Points per game through three games for the duo of Westbrook and Durant. They’re undoubtedly the best duo in the NBA and are putting together a resume for best duo ever.</p>
