  <article class="post-content">
    <p>D.J. Augustin, an underrated part of the Reggie Jackson trade last season, will look to continue his success as a backup point guard in the 2015-16 season.</p>

<p>Augustin played just 28 games with the Thunder last season, and though he didn’t particularly shine, he brought smart and solid play to the Thunder’s second unit. In 24 minutes per game, he averaged 7.3 points and 3.1 assists.</p>

<p>He are a few things that we are looking for with Augustin this season.</p>

<h3 id="minutes">Minutes</h3>

<p><img src="/content/2015-10-23/Augustin 1.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" /></p>

<p class="tagline">Sue Ogrocki – The Associated Press</p>

<p>Augustin will begin the season as the Thunder’s backup point guard, but unlike last season, he may end up with some competition for that role. Cameron Payne, the Thunder’s first round draft pick out of Murray State, is a highly regarded rookie who will no doubt be looking to climb the depth chart.</p>

<p>Payne actually outplayed Augustin for the most part in preseason, and though that won’t necessarily be characteristic of the season, it’s something to look out for. The Thunder certainly drafted Payne with the future in mind, but who knows if that future will come sooner than expected.</p>

<p>Another scenario is Payne and Augustin sharing time, but considering they’ll be backing up Russell Westbrook, there won’t be a lot of minutes to go around. It’ll be interesting to see who holds the backup job by the end of the season.</p>

<h3 id="assists">Assists</h3>

<p><img src="/content/2015-10-23/Augustin 2.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" /></p>

<p class="tagline">Sue Ogrocki – The Associated Press</p>

<p>Augustin has never been an assist machine by any means, but in his time with Oklahoma City last season he just averaged 3.1 assists per game, down almost two from the 4.9 he was averaging in Detroit in about the same amount of minutes played.</p>

<p>Augustin will likely see most his minutes with guys like Dion Waiters, Anthony Morrow and Enes Kanter, and this should give him plenty of opportunities to find open shots for his teammates. He can be a big part of a second unit that may be a defensive nightmare, but that should be able to score with ease.</p>

<p>Look for Augustin to do some more distributing and up his assist numbers this season.</p>

<h3 id="shooting">Shooting</h3>

<p><img src="/content/2015-10-23/Augustin 3.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" /></p>

<p class="tagline">Soobum Im - USA TODAY Sports</p>

<p>Augustin is a career 40 percent shooter, but shot just 37 percent with the Thunder last season. This includes about 35 percent from three, down from his career percentage of 37.</p>

<p>Augustin is not anywhere near the top of the list when it comes to Thunder scoring options, but he’s got to be able to score when open, and it would be excellent to see him hover around 40 percent from three, a number he’s eclipsed a few times in his career.</p>

<p>Augustin shot about 27 percent in preseason, and only made one 3-pointer in 10 attempts. Shooting like this may find him in a position with less minutes, so it will be interesting to see how he can improve as the regular season opens.</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015-10-23/Augustin 4.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" /></p>

<p class="tagline">Sue Ogrocki – The Associated Press</p>

<p>Augustin is a smart player who should continue to succeed as a backup point guard, and as long as he is able to keep his place on the depth chart, he should provide some positive contributions for the Thunder this season.</p>
