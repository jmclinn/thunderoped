Berry Tramel of the Oklahoman just wrote an article claiming the trade that sent James Harden to Houston exactly three years ago has become "less tolerable" as the years have passed. He poses that due to the lack of championship rings in OKC, Sam Presti failed. That keeping Harden for his contract season, without an details on what could have happened had he left town on another team's max offer sheet, would have been superior to three seasons of injuries leading to two playoff series losses and whatever you want to call last year. It now lies in "what-might-have-been land". So let us go there for arguments sake.

### How do we value a trade?

First, however, what goes into valuing a trade? Circumstance changes everything, and the championship aspirations of the OKC Thunder can't be ignored. Yes, Harden is probably the best shooting guard in the NBA today. Yes, star power decides championships. Had Harden been a malcontent, unhappy with his role, Sam Presti could have sent him to Houston, and the narrative would have been filled with 'locker room cancer' talk. This was never even close to the case, but James Harden did believe in his abilities and was never going to become the James Harden we see today had he remained in OKC.

When the trade initially happened the Thunder obtained players, namely Kevin Martin, and three draft picks. They set themselves up financially for the future to re-sign Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, remain well under the cap to go after potential free agent role players, and those draft picks had deadly potential in the hands of Sam Presti and his staff.

When the Thunder extended Ibaka and Harden continually said that he wasn't involved with his contract negotiations and they were up to his agent, it was the first signs that Presti could potentially pull the trigger. He did. The Thunder have sense had two key injuries during playoff series that have resulted in the only playoff series losses since they reached the Finals with Harden. One of Tramel's two main points is that Harden would have been able to stem the tide of Westbrook going down. That would have left the bench depleted, and the Thunder needed all three of their stars as was demonstrated when Harden disappeared in the Finals. So we can't value a trade by what might have happened. We have to look at what it gave versus what it would have given.

### Harden = Adams, McGary, Abrines, and more...

Kevin Martin left town a year later, Jeremy Lamb never panned out and is now looking to make a name in Charlotte. Those three draft picks turned into Steven Adams, Mitch McGary, and Alex Abrines. They are what we have to dissect the trade. We have to ignore Martin's departure and the absurd cap rise. We have to be fair to the moment and what assets are currently making an impact for OKC.

Harden would have never been the Harden we know today. If he was, his openly clear aspirations to win MVP could very well be tearing a rift in a locker room of a team trying to mesh under a new system. Harden wasn't in OKC to surpass Westbrook or Durant. He was the sixth man meant to tear apart opposing benches. It was a strength of the team that struggled with depth, especially in the front court. OKC brought in the ghost of Kendrick Perkins as an improvement to its inside defensive presence, and in the years sense has routinely switched out its backup center. When Eric Maynor tore his ACL he was never the same. Reggie Jackson was Maynor's replacement, but he was more in the mold of a Westbrook or Harden than a Maynor. He could drive and finish, and has shown the ability to take over games for short stretches. He needs the ball in his hands to be effective, and with Harden in town this would have never happened.

Harden runs the Houston offense through himself much as he ran the Thunder's second unit. Reggie Jackson filled that role. He didn't replace Harden, but he filled his role. He wouldn't have become the player he is today with Harden still in OKC. With those opportunities, no matter what you think of Reggie Jackson's abilities, he was able to command a major contract as well as send significant trade pieces to the Thunder. These included Enes Kanter and D.J. Augustin.

Also included in the Reggie Jackson trade was Kendrick Perkins. He and Nick Collison were the only consistent big man for the Thunder until Steven Adams was drafted with one of the draft picks from the Harden trade. Adams learned quickly from Perkins on the defensive end, and his added athleticism has allowed him to become the starting center of the Thunder. He's a solid defender, is improving his catch for pick and role finishes, and has a decent hook shot. His development is one of the primary reasons the Thunder were comfortable sending Perkins away for Kanter. Without Adams and cap flexibility the Thunder may have been forced to keep what remained of Perk out of sheer necessity.

The Thunder also felt comfortable keeping Kanter, because even with his contract they will be able to sign Durant in free agency while avoiding the repeater tax. Having Harden's contract on the roster, even as the cap inflates next year, hurts the limited flexibility the team has. The past few seasons free agent signings have been rare, but acquisitions like Anthony Morrow wouldn't have been possible.

This team's depth has been growing steadily due to the repercussions of losing Harden. McGary is a future impact player with a very nice offensive skill set already. Alex Abrines can hit shots from deep and is still gaining experience playing in Europe. Those are two of the three draft picks the Thunder received for Harden, and they are either on the fringe of the rotation or half the world away because of how deep this team is.

To be fair to Berry Tramel, the fact that all the trade pieces haven't had time to show their full return yet was acknowledged in his article, albeit in passing. He didn't, however, take into account that major superstar injuries end playoff runs no matter who you are, and because the Thunder traded James Harden they have been able to put together their deepest team yet. They have the flexibility to re-sign their three stars and the depth to push for not just one, but multiple championships in the immediate future.

The future is bright. The Houston Rockets gained a superstar, but the Thunder have the better team. And it's sustainable.

You can't gauge the value of a trade simply because a team has had crippling injuries and hasn't won a championship. There are no guarantees in this league.
