Energy (diving for loose balls and sprinting back on defense) and strength (he isn't getting moved by anyone on defense) will never be in short supply for Steven Adams.

Here are a few things to look for with Adams this year:

### Offense

- Don't need big number but is capable (Rookie season @DET 17 pts - 10 reb - 3 blk - 3 ast)

- Hook shot 

- Screens and use within new system (which leads to...HANDS)

### Hands

- Big men are often referred to by their hands --> Perkins had 'bricks' for hands, kanter has 'soft' hands. Where does Adams fall?

- In past has talked about practicing receiving rifle passes at his head to better prepare for working alongside Westbrook. Against the Mavs he caught one beautifully as Westbrook dumped it down to him under the basket, and then a few plays later it bounced off his hands out of bounds. Improving on consistency here could be a big plus for the Thunder.

- Adams has a big scar running down the back of the hand he broke last season; a reminder of the glove he wore for a good chunk of games and the halted progress in his post catches and especially his free throw shooting.

Kanter should continue his overall success with the Thunder this year, and is an exciting part of an offense that features two things it’s never really had on a consistent basis: post scoring and three point shooting depth. Whether he starts or comes off the bench, look for him to be a big part of the Thunder’s success this season.
