        <title>Steven Adams Season Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-16/0.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Mark D. Smith - USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the 2012-13 season there were no mysteries about what type of player the Thunder were going to draft. They had the 12th pick and they needed a big man. OKC fans were in the midst of screaming for Perkins’ head, and no matter whether Presti listened or not (he didn’t) there was no hiding the inevitable: Perkins was overpriced and didn’t have any knees left. The Thunder needed a center for the future who could learn from Perk before he left town and who could dole out the same type of punishments. Enter Adams and his bone-crushing screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was two seasons ago, and support for Adams has grown in similar fasion to his hair and personality. Energy (diving for loose balls and sprinting back on defense) and strength (he isn’t getting moved by anyone on defense) will never be in short supply for Steven Adams. The raw athleticism and potential have always been there, but his game is continuing to expand. I’ve ignored defense for this post, because we already know the reason Billy Donovan appears to favor Adams in his starting lineup this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things to look for with Adams this year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;offense&quot;&gt;Offense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-16/3.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Darren Abate – Associated Press&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential has always been there for Adams. In only his fifth outing for the Thunder during his rookie season he dropped 17 points and 10 rebounds on Detroit when facing another up and coming inside force, Andre Drummond. He also added 3 blocks, a steal, and 3 assists while shooting 70 percent. Adams is strong, and his size and rugby background have set him up perfectly for battling around the basket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder don’t expect, or need, Adams to put up those type of numbers on anything resembling a regular basis. His inside presence on the offensive end, however, results in lots of offensive rebounds, and any extra possesions in a lineup with the three-headed offensive snake of Durant-Westbrook-Ibaka is dangerous against any opponent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adams isn’t simply restricted to offensive rebounds though. He has been improving on a hook shot that has looked deadly at times. It will be interesting to see how it has improved in the offseason and how Coach Donovan may or may not utilize it. Additionaly, setting screens was a reason I was high on Adams coming out of Pitt in his single college season. Last year Adams would open up a direct path down the lane for Westbrook as he screened multiple defenders out of the way. With Durant injected back into the lineup, and with Donovan’s spacing offense, it will be intriging to see what using Adams as a moving wall can do for the Thunder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hands&quot;&gt;Hands&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-16/2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;David Zalubowski – Associated Press&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big men in the NBA are often referred to by their hands. How do they catch passes, and how is their touch around the basket? Kendrick Perkins had ‘bricks’ for hands. Enes Kanter has ‘soft’ hands. Where does Adams fall? Somewhere in between probably. Considering his skillset and those of Westbrook and Durant, having ‘soft’ hands will be important as Adams continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past Adams has talked about practicing receiving rifle passes at his head to better prepare for working alongside Westbrook. Against the Mavs he caught one beautifully as Westbrook dumped it down to him under the basket, and then a few plays later it bounced off his hands out of bounds. Improving on consistency here could be a big plus for the Thunder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adams has a scar running down the back of the hand he broke last season; a reminder of the glove he wore for a good chunk of games and the halted progress in his post catches and especially his free throw shooting (despite making the lefty, one-hander seconds after braking his hand). In the preseason, Adams’ free throw shooting mechanics look improved, and he has mentioned free throw shooting as an area he worked on in the offseason. It’ll be interesting to see what difference it makes once there’s a larger sample size to go off of. Adams could be a major asset at the end of games defensively if he isn’t a liability with Hack-A-Kiwi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opponent-aggravation&quot;&gt;Opponent Aggravation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-16/1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Mark D. Smith – USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adams has been the model pupil when it comes to ‘tricks of the trade.’ Big man coach Mark Bryant hasn’t been shy giving Adams tips on hooking arms, grabbing, and shoving opposing big men when battling down low without alerting the refs. By combining these talents with the stoic, calm demeanor he maintains throughout games he has found another useful skill: Aggravating his opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His rookie season he tallied multiple opponent ejections for his efforts, but last season players adjusted enough to keep their rage in check. Less punches were thrown at Adams (see Zach Randolph) but frustrations still ran high, and in the game of basketball frustration easily turns into uncessesary fouls and easy mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If nothing else, it’s an amusing piece of Adams’ game and personality to follow, but there’s a reason guys in the NBA trash talk. Adams may have perfected it without needing to open his mouth. What to watch for is when the refs will catch on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-6/collison-adams.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Steven Adams – Instagram&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know what Adams brings defensively. There’s only optimism in his development, and he’s a hard worker with offensive potential as well. Include his budding friendship with Nick Collison, chronicled &lt;a href=&quot;/2015-10-10-steven-adams-quotes/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s a chance that his overall cerebral approach to the game builds as well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Enes Kanter Season Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-15/1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Sue Ogrocki - Associated Press&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enes Kanter is coming off of his best season yet in the NBA, one that was split between the Utah Jazz and the Thunder. Kanter became a member of the Thunder after Sam Presti pulled the trigger on a blockbuster deal that also landed Oklahoma City D.J. Augustin, Kyle Singler and Steve Novak. He jumped right into his new role in OKC, and now is here to stay after signing a monster 4-year contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 26 games with the Thunder, his minutes went up, as did his production. In 31 minutes per game, up four from his time with the Jazz, he averaged 18.7 points on 57 percent shooting and 11 rebounds. Perhaps most impressive was that he averaged five offensive rebounds per game. Looking at numbers like these, there isn’t much room to question Kanter’s worth for the Thunder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things to look for with Kanter this year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;post-scoring&quot;&gt;Post scoring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-15/2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Mark D. Smith – USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kanter brings the Thunder something its never truly had on a consistent basis, and that is low post scoring. Serge Ibaka has never developed much in that area, and having bigs like Steven Adams and Kendrick Perkins has never helped fill that void either. This makes Kanter a crucial part of what should prove to be an explosive Thunder offense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we should expect to see some midrange game and perhaps a few three pointers here and there, Kanter should really be earning his money in the paint. Last year he shot 83, 53 and 66 percent on dunks, hook shots and layups respectively. These shots are all products of working hard in the post, and the efficiency he’s shown in that area shows his offensive strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great thing about Kanter’s post scoring is that it takes some of the offensive pressure of the Thunder’s big three of Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and Ibaka, and it should also help open up shots for guys like Dion Waiters, Anthony Morrow and D.J. Augustin. Kanter’s success in the post should help the Thunder reach its full potential offensively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rebounding&quot;&gt;Rebounding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-15/3.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Mark J. Terrill – Associated Press&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kanter is an excellent rebounder on both sides of the floor, and his 11 rpg with the Thunder shows that. He also had a total rebounding percentage of 19 with the Thunder, which would have put him amongst the league leaders were it for the whole season. While his time with the Thunder carries a limited sample size so far, there’s no reason to believe he can’t keep up numbers like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kanter’s defensive rebounding is important because it can help the Thunder reduce second chance opportunities on defense, and it gives the Thunder some back up on the glass for when Ibaka is focusing on protecting the rim. It also allows Kanter to contribute on the defensive side of the court, an area where he struggles overall (more on that later). His offensive rebounding is extremely important as well, as it will give a Thunder offense with so many scoring options extra chances, something that should allow the team to dominate games offensively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kanter is one of the better rebounders the Thunder has had, so look for him to continue his success crashing the boards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defense&quot;&gt;Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-15/4.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Mark D. Smith – USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should be Thunder fans’ biggest concern for the young center. Defense is really the only noticeable hole in Kanter’s game. In fact, with Kanter on the court for OKC last year, the opponent’s offensive rating was 111.7, and with him off it was 103.9. This shows that his defensive capabilities have been severely lacking up to this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to say what the primary cause of this, but after watching him play, it seems like a mix of lack of effort and limited basketball IQ on the defensive side. He is a young guy, entering just his fifth year in the NBA, and is now on a great team with an exciting new coach, so for now Thunder fans should remain optimistic that he can improve on the defensive side. His offense and rebounding skills are there and still improving, and hopefully his defense will soon follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Kanter can improve defensively, there’s really nothing keeping him from being one of the best centers in the league. That’s a big if, but only time will tell what improvements he is able to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-15/5.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Russ Isabella – USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kanter should continue his overall success with the Thunder this year, and is an exciting part of an offense that features two things it’s never really had on a consistent basis: post scoring and three point shooting depth. Whether he starts or comes off the bench, look for him to be a big part of the Thunder’s success this season.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mitch McGary Season Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-14/0.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitch McGary is entering his sophomore season in the NBA and will look to avoid a sophomore slump. He performed well and quickly became a fan favorite last season with his endless hustle. The man is nothing short of a spark plug and does a lot of things effectively, and anything he cannot do he will attempt with full vigor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In limited action last season – he only appeared in 32 games with 2 starts – he averaged 6.3 ppg, 5.2 rpg, and 0.4 apg in just over 15 minutes per game. For playing just a little over one quarter of the game, those are good returns. He makes a great change of pace big that has a different skill set than the rest of our guys. He prefers to play with his face to the basket and has shown flashes of brilliance in his passing game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some things we would like to see from McGary this season:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hustle&quot;&gt;Hustle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-14/1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Matt York - Associated Press&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McGary will likely not be a permanent fixture in the lineup. He will generally not enter and exit the game at scheduled intervals like we typically saw with Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant under former coach Scottie Brooks. He will be a spell type guy that comes in to give Steven Adams/Serge Ibaka/Enes Kanter a break. If any of the first 3 bigs get in foul trouble then we may see extended minutes from McGary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McGary brings many of the same attributes to the Thunder as veteran big man Nick Collison. He brings a passing ability not often seen from the block and he plays tenacious defense. The biggest limit on McGary’s playing time may be his propensity for fouling. In his 15 mpg he averaged 2.3 fouls per game. This will work perfectly with what his role for the Thunder should be this year. He will be able to disrupt opposing bigs and will not have to worry about pacing his fouling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;passing&quot;&gt;Passing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-14/2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Chris Humphreys - USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of McGary’s most talked about attributes coming out of college and transitioning into the pros. He quickly showed off the ability to make creative passes. This will be an important asset in the new offense. This preseason he has played 23 minutes and 17 minutes respectively in the Thunder’s two games this far. He has had 3 assists and 2 assists in those two games. Not great, but also not bad for a big in limited game time. Side note: McGary also hit a three in the second game against Fenerbahçe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rebounding&quot;&gt;Rebounding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-14/3.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Sue Ogrocki - Associated Press&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebounding and defense will be the opportunities for McGary to shine most. He averaged a little over 5 per game last season. This is a great return for the limited court time he saw. The man is a beast on the boards. This is the stat where his hustle shows up the most. McGary has proven difficult to stop and keep off the boards. He reached double digit rebounds in 5 games last season including a season (and career) high of 13 against Dallas. He also contributed 12 points on 5/11 shooting that game. Late in February McGary scored 20 points on 10/13 shooting while also pulling down 9 boards. The man knows how to operate around the basket and will continue to be a beast this season on the glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-14/4.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Mitch McGary - Tumblr.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitch McGary should continue his growth in the NBA this season. Whether or not he sees more minutes this season is yet to be decided. Last season he played significant amounts while Steven Adams and Serge Ibaka missed games due to injury. Either way, he will make the most of any opportunities given. He will be an exciting player to watch all season.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Eyeball Test: Mavericks @ Thunder</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;dal-88---okc-100&quot;&gt;DAL 88 - OKC 100&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amongst Fox Sports Oklahoma injecting commercials in the middle of play, the Thunder also faced some preseason struggles. Rookie Cameron Payne started them off after getting the ball on a fast break, then throwing an overly nifty pass over his shoulder to…. no one. And off we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the spacing fails, where this offense goes could get interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s still preseason, so learning the new schemes and becoming comfortable in them is key. However, I’m very interested to see how coach Billy Donovan will react when various lineups or schemes aren’t working. In the moment, how flexible will he be? We were all reminded as we watched the Warriors in the playoffs last season how important flexibility is (not just roster flexibility which the Thunder also possess, but flexibility of the coaching staff) for continued success. If Donovan can utilize his pieces on the fly as well as it appears he can when having a summer and a training camp to set them up, this could be a very impactful part of the Thunder’s future success.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This new-look Thunder bench could be a massive spark as easily as it could be a potential frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bench energy is scary good. Defense is questionable, and it looks like there could be a tendency to simply trade baskets. This energy though…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adam’s free throws? Not as ‘on fleek’ as he joked they would be during media day, but the mechanics and arc look much better.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bad news: Ibaka still has bricks for hands. Good news: Adams’ hands appear to be moving closer to ‘malleable clay’.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brian Davis needs no preseason warmup. The guy is already in midseason form.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Westbrook is also in ‘midseason’ form, which is scary to think what midseason form could actually look like.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cameron Payne can shoot. He’s also confident, which will help him grow, but makes it endlessly more entertaining when rookie mistakes rear their head.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discipline was an issue under Scott Brooks, and Donovan has his work cut out for him. Everything the players have been saying is in line with them buying in. However, sloppy isolation plays have been a weak spot before, and a struggling Durant resorted back to them at times against the Mavs. Was it the result of being unable to pass out of a designed double team due to missed execution? Probably at times, but it raises an interesting question of how disciplined this team can actually be. When the offense starts to falter how will the team, and especially its stars, stick to Donovan’s script and maintain discipline that it’s lacked in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dion Waiters missing layups? Check. Dion Waiters stepping back so far for a jumper that he traveled? Check. #waitersbeingwaiters&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like Adams starting. He makes the most sense starting, and he’s been effective this preseason in that role. However, I also like the look of Adams with the bench squad. What ended up being rotation adjustments due to a Kanter sprained ankle, Adams spent some time with the bench in the fourth quarter. He gave them an interior presence. When he goes straight up he creates a human wall. He also matches the energy of the second unit, and seems to give them a boost of confidence on the defensive end that they could use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Injury update: Ankle tweeks. Mitch McGary shook his off early in the game for some great plays as the game went on, but Enes Kanter wasn’t so lucky. He came down funny and ended up in the locker room. Hope it’s not serious. He was a beast down on the low block last season, and that doesn’t seem to have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;eyeball-test&quot;&gt;Eyeball Test?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sloppy&lt;/strong&gt;. Two efficient blowouts didn’t lead to a third for the first televised look at the 2015-16 Thunder.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Brodie: Russell Westbrook Season Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-13/0.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Westbrook at Fashion Week (source GQ)&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:500px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last season was huge for Russell Westbrook. It was his first (and hopefully last) season being the only superstar on a team. He showed the world he is more than capable of carrying an NBA team on his shoulders. With an injury depleted roster, he took the Thunder to the brink of the playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Westbrook averaged nearly a triple-double last season en route to setting career highs in scoring (28.1), rebounding (7.3), and assists (8.6) per game. He also missed a few games (15) himself after fracturing his cheek and adding “superhero” accessories to his ever expanding fashion palate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Thunder to have a successful season and live up to expectations here are a few things we must see from Russell Westbrook:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;attack&quot;&gt;Attack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-13/1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;source: Kyle Phillips - The Norman Transcript&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:500px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attack, attack, attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new offense relies on spacing. Keeping the court open for a player who is basically Flubber will make Westbrook even more of a threat. At any given point in the game Westbrook could be on the floor with a line up of jump shooters that will punish a defense for sagging in to stop Westbrook’s penetration. Kevin Durant, Serge Ibaka, Enes Kanter, and Dion Waiters (or Kyle Singler, or Anthony Morrow, or DJ Augustin) provide four more than capable outlets to keep defenses honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;distribute&quot;&gt;Distribute&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-13/2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;source: Mark D. Smith - USA TODAY Sports&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:500px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the most written and talked about aspect of Westbrook’s game - his passing. Does he do it enough? I think he does and you should too. Westbrook is not a typical point guard nor should we want him to be. He has a unique skill set. He has the ability to attack the paint like a swing man but still has the ability and awareness to make amazing passes and put his teammates in positions to score. I expect his assist numbers to go up again this season. He will not be the only creator on the court this season. This will take pressure off him to score 30+ per night and ft here will be nights when he finishes with fit around 20 and 15+ assists. He will be surrounded by the most talented roster assembled in OKC history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;health&quot;&gt;Health&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-13/3.jpg&quot; title=&quot;source: Mark D. Smith - USA TODAY Sports&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:500px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staying healthy will be necessary for every player, but specifically for Westbrook as he has picked up freak injuries twice in the last couple seasons. The torn meniscus against the Rockets in the playoffs 3 years ago ruined the playoffs that season and then was felt into the next season as well when he had to have an unexpected third surgery. Knee injuries always give me the heebie-jeebies no matter how far removed we are from the original injury. Then last season in the middle of a stretch matched only by Michael Jordan he suffered a zygomatic fracture. He essentially dented his face. Westbrook has to remain absolutely healthy this season. The Thunder need 82 regular season games from him. DJ Augustin is a capable back up, and Cameron Payne is an exciting young prospect, but neither of them are the point guard to lead this team - only Westbrook can do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Westbrook will put together another great season. He may not average 28 ppg again, but he will hover around 22 ppg while increasing his assists and maintaining his rebounds per game. He will finish as a top 5 MVP vote getter again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-13/4.jpg&quot; title=&quot;source: Mark D. Smith - USA TODAY Sports&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:500px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s to you, Brodie. Have another great season.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Steven Adams: Quotes, Pics, and GIFs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Steven Adams - Nick Collison summer bromance continued two days ago when the Thunder did a slightly New Zealand themed sitdown with the two. Also, before we get going here, all the quotes and images were taken from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nba.com/thunder/news/collison_adams_1510&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; available on the Thunder website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;framing-the-shot&quot;&gt;Framing the Shot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever encuntered any of the guys on the team in real life they aren’t the shortest people in the crowd, but some people are taller than others. Nick Gallo is looking short already, and it doesn’t help when Adams appears to be sitting in a high chair that doesn’t quite fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-09/8.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin:0 auto;width:500px;max-width:100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hair-v-hair&quot;&gt;Hair v Hair&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve’s hair is always good for a discussion, but with Nick Collison there for comparison the Kiwi deferred to the elder statesman when asked “Who has the better hair?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-09/2.gif&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin:0 auto;width:500px;max-width:100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adams: The classic comb-over. Tell them about your comb in the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collison [reluctantly]: I’m the only player to have a comb in the bathroom…in Thunder history…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adams: No, his is absolutely classic. Mine is just messy and gross. All over the place. I’m like the wild little brother. He’s the civilized human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-recurring-green-drink&quot;&gt;The Recurring Green Drink&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what fascinated me about this, but Adams makes it great. In comparison to him it looks absurdly small, and based on his reaction I’m not quite sure he’s supposed to be drinking it on camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-09/3.gif&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin:0 auto;width:500px;max-width:100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But nonetheless he keeps going back in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-09/7.gif&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin:0 auto;width:500px;max-width:100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;receiving-praise&quot;&gt;Receiving Praise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Collison says Adams is “going to be really good” and that he’s already “good now” Adams has to cool off his blushing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-09/4.gif&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin:0 auto;width:500px;max-width:100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He got so flustered he had to be reminded where the camera was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-09/5.gif&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin:0 auto;width:500px;max-width:100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stealing-the-show&quot;&gt;Stealing the Show&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Collison is a smart dude with insightful answers, but what are you supposed to do when this guy is next to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-09/1.gif&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin:0 auto;width:500px;max-width:100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-09/9.gif&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin:0 auto;width:500px;max-width:100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calm and collected isn’t Adams’ style unless he’s getting under an opposing player’s skin on the court. This series of photos all took place within about 10 seconds of each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-09/6.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin:0 auto;width:95%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very curious to know who was off to Adams’ right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;never-ending-quotes&quot;&gt;Never-Ending Quotes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since Adams &lt;a href=&quot;http://newsok.com/article/5376283&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;relayed&lt;/a&gt; his welcome to the NBA moment involving Perkins a.k.a “The Only Silverback”, you have to be on quote and story alert. The man never fails to disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(on the new coaching staff)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adams: One thing that stuck out is Monty’s family. He’s got a large offspring. Just a lot of kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(on Adams’ Castaway Halloween costume)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collison: You had a FedEx box, and didn’t you pack sandwiches in the box that you could eat throughout the night?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adams: That’s a marathon. I have to be prepared. So I put the sandwiches in the FedEx box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collison: And he was just sneaking them the whole night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bromance&quot;&gt;Bromance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You always hear Russell Westbrook is a really goofy dude, but Adams never hides it. These guys are having fun, and you have to love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good to have Steven back on the floor, and here’s to more laughs and bone-crushing screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-09/10.gif&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin:0 auto;width:500px;max-width:100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2015-16 Season Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There were some huge changes this offseason that will have profound impacts on the future of basketball in Oklahoma City. There were changes at the top of the coaching staff along with an unfortunate amount of physical therapy and surgeries. But the future is bright again in Oklahoma City – and it is not just from the absolute star that Russell Westbrook has grown into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most exciting thing that happened for the Thunder this offseason was Kevin Durant receiving a clean bill of health and returning to regular basketball activities. With high expectations going into the 2014-2015 NBA season, Durant and Oklahoma City received terrible news. He would be diagnosed with a Jones’ fracture. He was initially expected to miss 6-8 weeks but this injury is tricky and Durant was shut down midway through the season, only appearing in 27 games that also included a nasty ankle sprain. Durant has had nearly a full season off and this could be a good thing. He has had a year of rest and rehab and should be back to his old Durant form. Even in limited action last season he averaged 25.4 ppg on 51% shooting while pulling down 6.6 rpg and dishing out 4.1 apg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If his preseason interviews have been any indication, Durant fully expects to return to his MVP winning caliber play. The free agency rumors will be ridiculous and we should all just settle in and get used to them. If Durant’s spat with Stephen A Smith is any indication, Durant is fired up, angry, and still not nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-6/kdnotnice.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;KD Is Not Nice: Property of Nike&quot; title=&quot;KD Is Not Nice: Property of Nike&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:25%;width:50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to getting an MVP back to full health, the Thunder made coaching changes as well. Gone are the days of Scotty Brooks and the countless radio call-ins claiming a new coach would be the saving grace of Oklahoma City basketball. We will find out this year under the newly hired helm of Billy Donovan. Coach Donovan has long been a favorite among college coaches expected to make the jump to the pros. He attempted it one time getting hired by the Orlando Magic, but quickly changed his mind and returned to the University of Florida. The man has a great track record of winning. He has accomplished nearly everything in the amateur game and expects to do the same in the NBA. His coaching and system have put a number of players into the Association and many of them have had success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donovan brings significant change to the thunder offensive scheme. Durant will spend less time on the ball running pick-and-rolls. The scheme relies on spacing and ball movement – seemingly the opposite of the Brooks system. This change will take pressure off of both Westbrook and Durant. The spacing should help our high number of jump shooters and should prove to be fun to watch. Durant will get more open jump shots and Enes Kanter and Serge Ibaka should continue to show off their mid-range touch. The most excited player about the change might be Anthony Morrow. He was absolutely fire from 3-pt range last season and should have even more space to operate this year (not that the fastest trigger in the West needs much space to get a shot off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be some familiar faces on the sidelines with Donovan. Though they will not be the main face of the staff this year, the assistants Donovan and Thunder GM Sam Presti have assembled are quite impressive. He will have two former NBA head coaches on the bench with him to help adjust to the length of the NBA season. Monty Williams, fresh off of a playoff season in New Orleans, will make the move to Oklahoma City and slide down the bench a spot. There is a familiar face to Thunder fans as well as Maurice Cheeks joins the Thunder staff for a second time. Many of us remember Cheeks being on the bench under Scotty Brooks when Oklahoma City won the Western Conference Finals and played the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals. The two Thunder assistants have combined to win 478 NBA games. There is another former college coach making the jump to the NBA too as OKC welcomes Anthony Grant to the bench. Grant was formerly a head coach at the University of Alabama and Virginia Commonwealth University. The Thunder also welcomes back Royal Ivey who played in Oklahoma City from 2010-2012, and in 2014 on a 10-day contract. Ivey was a member of the NBA Finals team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Russell Westbrook proved to the rest of the league last year what Oklahoma City already knew. He is a true superstar. Westbrook and Durant give the Thunder two of the top five NBA players in the same starting line-up. Many people will talk about how they will be unable to co-exist. “Russell is too ball dominant. He does not understand he is not the star.” Those people are wrong. Westbrook is a playmaker and has to have the ball in his hands to do that. Sure, he sometimes gets tunnel vision, but we all saw last year that he is capable of going 1-on-5 and making special things happen. Throw Durant on the court and things open up even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a fun season for all Oklahoma City fans. This is the deepest roster assembled to play at the ‘Peake. There is a new coach eager to prove he belongs. We have an MVP returning who wants his name back in the discussion for best player in the Association, and a point guard who is absolutely terrifying when he is pursuing a goal. Steven Adams and Serge Ibaka will protect the paint while Andre Roberson harasses other guards on the wings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second unit will be more than serviceable when the starters need a breather. Kyle Singler looks to regain his long distance form while Dion Waiters will continue to create. DJ Augustin will put the second unit guys into positions to succeed. Nick Collison and Steve Novak, with shrinking minutes but increasing locker room rolls will provide tutelage for the young guys Mitch McGary, Josh Heustis and Cameron Payne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The season is near. Get up. Get loud. Get excited.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Thunder&#39;s New Challenge</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenge&quot;&gt;Challenge.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t think of a better word to describe both the charge and approach of OKC Thunder coach Billy Donovan. This team is established, the pecking orders are set, and the players know their roles. Scotty carved the game board and whittled the pieces, crafting with care despite all the noise. Now it’s Donovan’s turn to set the pieces to the board for maximum output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the last day of April coach Donovan has been watching film. Who goes where and why? How to learn from how Brooks utilized his assets and how to grow from there. All the soundbites suggest the Thunder’s new coach didn’t arrive with any preconceived notions and believed his first job was to learn about his new team. From what we saw at the first public appearance of the 2015-16 Thunder, I’m inclined to believe no smoke had been blown. At the annual Blue and White Scrimmage, based on the limited quotes and video clips available, two of the most quoted lines coming from the Thunder and Donovan over the past few months are what stood out the most: A focus on spacing and schemes that maximize unique player strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Billy Donovan says Dion Waiters has underrated passing abilities and the box score says Dion Waiters led the game with 8 assists it appears he might be on to something. When the Thunder are seen running this play I’m sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-video&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Watch: Highlight from the Blue &amp;amp; White: Westbrook to Collison to Durant to Zanna. &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/krEneZBjCP&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/krEneZBjCP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; OKC THUNDER (@okcthunder) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/okcthunder/status/650813679361875968&quot;&gt;October 4, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet to be fair, it’s beyond early to make any lasting assumptions, and the last defensive domino to fall on that play featured Enes Kanter in quicksand. Anyone could say what works for Durant won’t work for Singler, as Donovan has previously, but when newly drafted Cameron Payne causally flips the ball into the hands of 3-point specialist Steve Novak for a game winning buzzer beater it shows not only the coach’s understanding of everyone involved but a willingness of the players to trust the play. A scrimmage is a scrimmage. The lights, sounds, and pressure of an NBA game change everything, but the future looks promising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This team is stacked, and expectations are always sky high. The national media will scream about a ‘closing window’, as they have for three seasons. Westbrook will still shoot the ball amidst continued rumblings that this simply detracts from Durant’s greatness. Durant free agency noise will reach fever pitch, but one challenge standing before the Thunder is a different kind of challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year wasn’t Team-KD versus Team-Russ as it was in years past. It was starters versus the bench. The individual greatness and leadership is now in hand, so cohesion has its chance to step forward. It’s what GM Sam Presti saw in the chance to hire Donovan, and it’s now Donovan’s job to see it through. This challenge isn’t one the Thunder face, but an opportunity they now possess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Steven Adams, get better man…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check back soon for 2015-2016 season previews!&lt;/p&gt;
