        <title>Eyeball Test: Suns @ Thunder</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;phx-103---okc-124&quot;&gt;PHX 103 - OKC 124&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder haven’t lost to the Suns at home for a few seasons, and they were able to keep that streak alive with a very solid victory Sunday night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The start looked good yet again. Solid defense and movement on offense, just like the Thunder have started the last few games. The question was whether it could last or not.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Westbrook had two steals early in the first quarter, cheating off his man and sneaking around behind the ball handler to grab it away for fast break opportunities. As the game went on Westbrook kept trying for steals, often letting his man blow by him to try and poke it away from behind. Gambling from Westbrook can lead to those explosive, sometimes game changing plays, but there’s a nice balance to be had.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ibaka and Kanter fought over a rebound again this game, turning it over. This is the dumbest kind of turnover, but those two may average one a game this season.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first few games Donovan seemed to be substituting out his lineups gradually, but more recently he’s been doing wholesale changes sitting the starters in bulk near the end of the first quarter. It hasn’t gone well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The great start to the game was completely negated by the bench. It was a collapse that has seen the Thunder spiral in several games. The double digit lead was completely erased, leaving the game tied heading into the second quarter. The turnover bug seemed to be about to strike again and Phoenix was blowing by the Thunder on defense. There’s too much talent on this bench for it to be this bad.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe stagger KD and Russ’ minutes early in the game if the bench can’t get into rhythm fast enough to stay off major losses in points?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Singler replaced Durant yet again. I think I almost understand why it theoretically makes sense, maybe. Waiters is already on the floor at this point, replacing Roberson as the first substitution. Waiters and Durant make the most logical 1-to-1 replacement, with ball-handling, scoring, and passing abilities. With Waiters already on the floor, however, Singler is the go to small forward replacement. However, when Durant sits why not just switch Waiters onto the opposing team’s 3? He has the size, and it would allow Donovan to bring in another guard (Morrow?) off the bench.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mitch McGary sighting early, and his struggles continued. Can’t get much floor time or get in rhythm when committing three fouls nearly instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Waiters stepped it up big time in the second quarter. He was the only bench production, and things really seemed to open up for him when Ibaka, and then Adams, checked back in to get some defensive stops, space the floor, and open Waiters up with good screens. The bench by itself wasn’t giving enough help to help Waiters get going.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems like the Thunder have collapsed in the latter half of the first quarter in multiple (if not most) games this season. The chemistry has been lacking when the bench takes over, and it doesn’t seem to regain a foothold until the starters have taken back over halfway through the second. It’s set up some very positive third quarters, but the team has lost big leads and good momentum in that late 1st, early 2nd chunk of the game. Against good teams this puts the Thunder in a hole early, and when Westbrook and Durant feel the pressure the chance of hero, iso ball gets a lot bigger. It’s happened three times already this season, and when the wheels fell off the bus they were never put back on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McGary checked back into the game in the third quarter. He was getting torched by Markieff Morris, but he started to calm down in general and added his energy. The bench activity was significantly elevated from the first quarter. It was an overall effort, but McGary will always bring energy. There’s a chance Donovan put him into the rotation, despite his obvious struggles, against Phoenix to try and force him to get going so that he can be a spark ready to go whenever it’s needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bench was able to maintain the lead and positive play leading into the fourth. The injection of the skill and energy of Westbrook and Durant midway through absolutely killed Phoenix. The pressure was off with a decent lead to begin with, and the ball movement from the start of the game continued. Late in games the two superstars have had isolation tendencies, especially when the game is close. This is a major step forward in terms of late-game execution, but will it hold up when the pressure mounts? It’s at least a start in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ibaka seemed a step behind all night, and has for a good portion of these first seven games. I hate to even think about worrying if he’s lost a step defensively.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Post game Donovan discussed ‘established players’ being professional and understanding that it’s a big picture where new guys need the opportunity to get comfortable so they can better contribute in the long run. He was talking about Collison, but it could also have shed some light on the Morrow/Singler minutes discrepancy. Everyone knows what Morrow brings, and Singler has been absolutely terrible since arriving in OKC. Maybe Donovan is desperately trying to get Singler going before utilizing a more balanced approach between those two players. This would make the most practical sense in the minutes that almost seem force-fed to Singler.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;eyeball-test&quot;&gt;Eyeball Test?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comfortable and collected.&lt;/strong&gt; They shouldn’t have lost, and they didn’t. The good parts got better, and the turnovers and late game execution troubles are definitely on positive upswings. The bench is still unpredictable, however, and needs to be at least consistent for this team to make the dent in the West that its capable of making.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Eyeball Test: Thunder @ Bulls</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;okc-98---chi-104&quot;&gt;OKC 98 - CHI 104&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On national television the Thunder started strong against Chicago, but late in the game bad defense, stagnation, and a rejuvenated Derrick Rose led to another disappointing loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once again the Thunder started very strong out of the gate. Lock down defense and great movement on the offensive end without the gamble plays that lead to turnovers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ibaka started 4/4 from the field, Westbrook started a 16 assist night early on with good finds, and Durant looked much stronger on defense while holding his ground against Mirotic in the post. The big three all looked engaged and ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Thunder also ended up in late shot clock possessions twice in the first quarter where they didn’t panic. They continued to move and look for the open man, and both plays ended with a made basket before the shot clock ran out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The defense inside to start was good, but 3-pointers from Chicago kept them in the game early.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Singler checked in for Durant. He continued to miss shots. I’ve mentioned this before (as has everyone covering the Thunder), but Singler’s minutes are very confusing. Morrow would be the likely player to get Singler’s minutes, but he hasn’t played well in the chances he’s receive either. The problem with that is, however, that the time Morrow sees on the floor is mostly without the starters where his perimeter spacing and catch and shoot abilities really stand out. He seems to be used in spots where he’s a cutter. Not the best use of Morrow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why can’t this offense keep up it’s good play for more than 8 or 9 minutes. As the first quarter ended isolation plays took over and Westbrook at one point posted up too far out 3 plays in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Durant looked like he was struggling, and not because he was missing shots. He just looked out to lunch. There were several hard drives to the basket where he was frustrated with no-calls, and maybe this turned off his drive for a while. Jimmy Butler was also destroying Durant on defense at this point in the game. Durant kept losing him off the ball as his old habit of ball watching reared its head.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Durant won MVP it was when he was forced to not only be the most skilled player for OKC, but also it’s motor. He had to bring the energy that disappeared when Westbrook was out. It elevated his game, and he was so much more engaged. When Westbrook is on the floor Durant has a habit of receding into the background, and there’s times when it’s easy to forget he’s even on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a while, Durant seemed to perk back up, and during the 3rd quarter he really stepped it up. The result? The Thunder went on an 8-2 run to tie the game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kanter really is a beast on offense. He gives maximum effort and was the reason the Thunder were able to stay in the game for a lot of the fourth simply by getting offensive rebounds and second possessions. The problem was that he can’t switch on defense. Adams isn’t the fastest laterally, but a little bit goes a long way sometimes. Kanter was definitely trying, however, and with Adams out with back problems he did his best to contain Rose. Rose had a special kind of determination last night to finish the game though, and Brian Windhorst drumming up rumors in the press probably didn’t help the Thunder.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The defensive adjustments didn’t come quickly enough to end the game. The Thunder were getting beat whether Rose shot or passed the ball, and the Bulls were able to run the exact same play multiple times to build their lead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Thunder looked overall much better against Chicago. The effort was much better, and they took much better care of the ball. The team just doesn’t look like it’s found its ‘identity’ yet, and some slip-ups in coverages didn’t help either. The attitude and look of this ball club seems to change every few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Donovan also needs to get a better handle on the roster and his lineups. He’s still figuring everything out, and it will definitely take time. Tape on the team can only teach you so much. It’s just disconcerting to see such a consistently dominant team over the past few years trying to figure out who it is.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;eyeball-test&quot;&gt;Eyeball Test?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confusing.&lt;/strong&gt; The Thunder are .500, and hopefully they’ve learned from the good and the bad to figure out their issues. Let’s just hope that addressing them one at a time doesn’t take too long and this team can get clicking sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Eyeball Test: Raptors @ Thunder</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;tor-103---okc-98&quot;&gt;TOR 103 - OKC 98&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder fall apart for a second game, turning the game over, literally, to Toronto in a sloppy, un-energetic loss. The turnovers continue to ruin spurts of very promising play and improving defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the loss to Houston, Durant said he needed to make a point to be a better leader and get his guys involved. He started the game looking to distribute, but it doesn’t help how much he passes to a wide open Roberson if he refuses to shoot the ball.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very promising defensive effort to start. Toronto didn’t get any good looks, and it seemed to fuel the offense (Scott Brooks wasn’t lying all those years it turns out). You can see the potential of this team, it just hasn’t been sustainable for more than a quarter at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adams seems like he’s getting better on offense every single game. He moves well in the pick-and-roll, and when he catches the ball it’s usually deep in the paint and results in an easy look.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Westbrook had 8 assists in the first quarter, and I feel like all of them were passes straight into the paint for easy looks. The offense was clicking to start this game even though the tempo was slower at times than this team wants to play at.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Kanter catches the ball anywhere near the basket it’s going up. Usually it’s a very good look, and Kanter has great moves in the post. Sometimes help comes, however, and he gets into trouble. And when more defenders get sucked in that means there’s a shooter open somewhere, and it would help if Kanter’s mind wasn’t entirely locked on scoring.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Singler. Good grief. 1. Fouls, fouls, fouls. 2. Absolute 0 on offense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So much for no turnovers. The second quarter completely erased what the first had accomplished, and despite curbing them a bit in the third the train had already derailed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fouling continuously was adding to the turnovers, giving away free points. Way too many fouls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This team could be frustrating for a good while. They have spurts of greatness, but there’s absolutely no consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At one point in the game Toronto was shooting 31% against OKC’s 50%, and the Thunder were +10 on rebounds. Somehow, the Thunder were only 6 points in the lead. A perfect example of how sloppy play is making winning a much harder task.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Morrow played over Singler (finally) in the fourth quarter. Singler was adding to the fouling epidemic, so it would have made no sense for him to see the floor, but it almost felt like that forced Donovan into playing Morrow. The lack of playing time for Morrow is very strange, especially proving what offensive spark he can bring last season and becoming a fan favorite. Donovan may be more talkative than Brooks, but what he’s actually thinking is just as mysterious (and maybe more so).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Absolutely zero urgency in the fourth quarter. Toronto should never have still been in the game, but they hung around because OKC never looked like they cared enough to put it away. They also didn’t score for the last 6 minutes of the game, which is unacceptable for any team. When you’ve allowed the opponent to go to the line twice the number of times you have, and you turn the ball over 19 times there’s no way you can get away with a scoreless finish to the game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kneejerk reactions are going to start flying about now, and it’s easy to see why. A learning curve will be hard for most fans to accept graciously, but when is it actually ok to start to worry? Donovan was brought in to bring some tactical skill on the offensive end that Brooks appeared to lack, but when are there too many X’s and O’s?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One last thing: When Rockets guard, Kyle Lowry, passed the ball to a referee after receiving a frustrating call he was given a technical foul, because the pass was “too hard and taken as a sign of aggression.” Seriously refs? Put your big boys pants on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;eyeball-test&quot;&gt;Eyeball Test?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inconsistent and lazy.&lt;/strong&gt; The Thunder have failed to impose their will on games by dictating tempo or style. Instead they’ve allowed their opponents to control the game, and despite the superior talent in OKC the turnovers and inconsistency across the board from minute to minute has plagued this team in a very bad way.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Game Recap: Raptors vs. Thunder</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;tor-103---okc-98&quot;&gt;TOR 103 - OKC 98&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turnovers destroyed the Thunder again tonight. It has been a common trope for Oklahoma City already this season. There is a learning curve when it comes to implementing a new offense, but after a full offseason, and now 5 games into the season there should be improvement. Unfortunately, when it comes to ball security there hasn’t been any improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder started the game out hot. They scored 23 in the first quarter while holding the Raptors to just 13. Kevin Durant went 3-6 to start and Russell Westbrook racked up 8 assists in the opening quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wheels fell off the bus in the second quarter though, and the roles got reversed. The Raptors put up 27 in the second quarter. Toronto only shot 44.4% in the quarter, but they got to the charity stripe 10 times, converting 9, compared to Oklahoma City’s just 2 trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With both teams having a successful offensive and defensive quarter in the first half, the third quarter was an offensive explosion. Oklahoma City put up 42 points in the quarter and Toronto put in 33. Russell Westbrook had 16 points and 5 assists in the quarter. Kevin Durant scored another 11 points in the quarter. The team shot an outstanding 72.7% from the floor including 6/9 from deep. The biggest difference in this quarter was the turnovers. The team limited the freebies to just two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth quarter was borderline atrocious for Oklahoma City. The Thunder shot just 25% from the field and went 1/6 from the arc. Toronto took advantage of the poor shooting performance and closed the gap over the quarter, ultimately surpassing and defeating the Thunder. The Raptors fourth quarter was efficient. The team shot 50% from the floor and made 13 trips to the free throw line knocking down 11 of the attempts. The fourth quarter was a bit of an enigma when someone looks at the minutes. Dion Waiters played all twelve minutes of the quarter while Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant played just 7:29 each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest take away from this game is that there is a pattern emerging. The Thunder still haven’t figured out late game execution. The offense became stagnant down the stretch. Instead of relying on the offense which saw Russell Westbrook hand out 15 assists in the first 3 quarters, the team began relying on one on one isolation plays again. The Scotty Brooks comparisons will now be prevalent for Billy Donovan until a successful late game offense emerges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder lost the lead inside of a minute left in the game. Kevin Durant took a turnaround fade away 14 foot jumper. Toronto rebounded the miss and Demar DeRozan converted a layup to put the Raptors up. Maybe the hardest part of the fourth quarter was when a jump ball came with 11 seconds left on the Thunder offensive end. Durant missed the back end free throw which Toronto rebounded. Westbrook made a hustle play and knocked the ball loose and Serge Ibaka jumped on the ball to tie it up. Ibaka should have won the tip, but miss-timed his jump essentially sealing the game for the Raptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ibaka had an efficient night scoring 10 points on 4/7 shooting and pulled down 6 rebounds. Unfortunately that is not the stat line of a player that Westbrook and Durant rely on as a safety valve to relieve pressure. Enes Kanter continued to impress though. He finished with 15 points on 7/11 shooting and pulled down 6 rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder are still working on settling into the new system and new coach. Growing pains are expected when there are changes like these. Donovan is still adjusting to the NBA and his players are still adjusting to the new leadership at the top. The season is young and this team is going to be crazy good once they limit the turnovers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Eyeball Test: Thunder @ Houston</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;okc-105---hou-110&quot;&gt;OKC 105 - HOU 110&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A desperate Rockets team reawoke its rivalry with the Thunder, allowing OKC to get emotional and sloppy and turn over the ball 24 times on the way to its first loss of the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Rockets were embarrassed, playing at home, playing against the Thunder which Harden always seems to get up for, and the Thunder were on the second night of a back-to-back. This screamed trap game from the tip.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harden blocking Ibaka? That seems backward and not a good sign early in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ibaka seemed off to start the game. A step behind on defense and clumsy on rebounds. He came to life as the game progressed, however with his fair share of blocks and rebounds to help OKC build its lead in the first half. It may be up and down for Ibaka the first few weeks of the season. He’s either been really good or really off.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kyle “Foul Machine” Singler strikes again. Guarding Harden is foul trouble waiting to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roberson and Singler saw time on the court together twice during the game. It seemed to work (somehow) in the first half, but that may have been more thanks to Waiters and Kanter however. When Donovan tried it again in the later part of the game it didn’t work so well, and he basically said so in his post game interview.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kanter blocked Harden, and then caused Howard to miss! Stop the presses! He seems to be improving on defense each game. He’s definitely trying.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;D.J. Augustin picked right up where he left off with great shooting. He did, however, have a few turnovers. He wasn’t the only one…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Durant’s one-on-one defense was great. He was blocking and altering shots regularly. He’s always had an uncanny ability to blow up a fast break, and it’s good to see that hasn’t changed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harden and Durant were trading 3-pointers to end the half. This rivalry will always be strong as long as the main players remain in the mix, and somehow Patrick Beverly is included in that.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The offensive rebounds in the first half were a big reason for the lead heading into the 3rd quarter. Ibaka and Adams were tearing it up under the basket, and the rebound advantage held for the Thunder the whole game. It should have been the reason the Thunder won the game, but there was another stat line that got in the way of that…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turnovers. Good grief. It’s been sloppy since the season began, but against a skilled and fast team like the Rockets those turnovers will kill you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As is par for the course with these two teams, frustrations began to build about halfway through the 3rd quarter. Howard threw Westbrook down and started locking arms with everyone. Westbrook began to force himself and passes into places neither could fit. Combine that with taking a foul as Durant’s shoe came off and Westbrook had to sit with his fourth foul, which spiraled the team out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The emotional control of this team is always on the brink of going over the edge of the cliff. With the raw energy Westbrook leads the team with it’s not hard to see why, but some coaches have the ability to stop the bleeding by recognizing the danger, calling a timeout, and potentially switching out players. Scott Brooks learned the necessity of this at times, especially against teams like the Rockets and Clippers. Other coaches like Popovich are always up off the bench when a big momentum shot goes against their team. Billy Donovan, did no such thing last night.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are obvious merits for Donovan’s fluid substitutions and calm game management, but sometimes a full stop is required. When the Thunder repeatedly gave the ball to the Rockets and momentum swung toward Houston in the 3rd, the Thunder continued to reel out of control. Westbrook was on the bench, and even the calming presence of Durant couldn’t change things. He was continually double-teamed and forced into turnovers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe Donovan didn’t fully understand the history between these two teams. Maybe he thinks a turnover is a turnover and the particular circumstances surrounding that part of the game don’t matter. Maybe he doesn’t like to make drastic changes in lineups and style, instead trying to get his players to correct their mistakes right then and there. It’ll be interesting to see what approach he takes the next time the Thunder lose their head and can’t get it back attached. I don’t think we’ll have that long to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other news, Westbrook seems to be inbounding the ball more often. An interesting look after Brook’s preference of having a lanky shooting guard take on this responsibility almost exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adams had trouble chasing down shooters on the perimeter when going up against the small ball lineups Houston kept rolling out. The tradeoff for offensive rebounds and inside presence seemed to be the way to go, however, at least in the first half.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ibaka has always fought for rebounds with is own teammates. Kanter is even worse at it. So when both are going after a rebound there’s a fairly high likelihood it’s going to end up in the hands of the other team.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;eyeball-test&quot;&gt;Eyeball Test?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional and sloppy.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve used the word sloppy here too much for having only played 4 games. These turnovers have to stop. 24 is too many to have a comfortable chance winning any game.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Game Recap: Thunder vs. Rockets</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;okc-105---hou-110&quot;&gt;OKC 105 - HOU 110&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma City head coach Billy Donovan experienced another milestone on his NBA journey tonight – his first loss as an NBA coach. The Thunder were muffled this evening and allowed James Harden to have his first break out game of the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Oklahoma City Thunder started slowly tonight. The first few minutes of the game were hectic, up and down the court basketball that featured several turnovers for both teams. After throwing the ball around loosely the Thunder finally settled in and took the lead. James Harden looked timid in the first quarter, waiting until there was just 6:31 left in the quarter to take his first shot of the game despite having open looks. Harden went on a quick scoring spurt though and hit several shots in the first quarter. The Thunder won the quarter by 5 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second quarter looked like it was going to be more of the same. The Thunder looked comfortable and in control of the game en route to pushing the lead to 10+ points. They took an 11-point lead into halftime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third quarter was not friendly to the Thunder. Russell Westbrook was limited in third quarter action after finding himself in foul trouble. He picked up 3 personal fouls in the quarter. The offense hit a roadblock and only scored 14 points in the quarter while Houston put up 28 and took the lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing losing for the first time, Russell Westbrook came out firing in the fourth quarter. He played all 12 minutes to close out the game going 5-8 and putting up 12 points in the quarter. It wasn’t enough, however, and Houston held on to win the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Harden finished with 37 points it took him a lot of shots to get there. He shot just 12-26 from the floor and 4-12 from the 3 point line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Durant had another good outing, scoring 29 points on 9-19 from the floor and 4-9 from deep. Russell Westbrook chipped in 25 on 10-16 shooting, and 3-6 from the arc. He nearly had a triple-double though, which is becoming a nightly threat, by dishing out 11 assists and pulling down 8 rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serge Ibaka had a bit of a disappointing game. He put up a double-double as well (12p, 11r), but he shot poorly and failed to assert himself early in the game when the Rockets began the game with James Harden guarding the Thunder big man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that hurt the Thunder the most in this game was turnovers. It’s something they have struggled with early in the season. The Thunder gave up 19 turnovers against the Spurs, 20 against the Magic, and finally seemed to limit TOs against the Nuggets giving up just 13 turnovers. Tonight against the Rockets the Thunder gave up 27 turnovers. No matter how bad the competition, if you give them 24 extra chances then the game becomes very difficult. The Rockets scored 21 points off of those 24 turnovers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder showed that the offense still has great potential – they shot better than the Rockets – but they have to treasure the ball more. It’s unfortunate that the first Thunder loss of the season was to the struggling Rockets, but it had to come at some point. A loss on the second night of a back to back on the road is not a terrible loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This team is fun to watch and they will be all season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up next: Thunder vs. Toronto Raptors in OKC at 7 p.m. CST.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thunder Weekly Forecast</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;games&quot;&gt;Games&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;monday-november-2-at-700-pm-cst--at-houston-rockets&quot;&gt;Monday, November 2 at 7:00 PM CST – at Houston Rockets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder opens the week against a struggling Rockets team that has lost each of its three games by 20 points. The Rockets have a great team and are certainly due to play more in line with their potential, so the Thunder can’t come into this game expecting an easy victory. They should look to get up early and stay up throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wednesday-november-4-at-700-pm-cst--vs-toronto-raptors&quot;&gt;Wednesday, November 4 at 7:00 PM CST – vs. Toronto Raptors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Raptors begin the week as one of just two undefeated Eastern Conference teams, playing well behind guys like Kyle Lowry, DeMar DeRozan and Jonas Valanciunas. The Raptors, like the Thunder, hold a deep roster with some dangerous players. The Thunder will have to play a strong game on both sides of the court to hold off their northern foes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thursday-november-5-at-700-pm-cst--at-chicago-bulls&quot;&gt;Thursday, November 5 at 7:00 PM CST – at Chicago Bulls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on how the Rockets game goes, this may be the toughest matchup for the Thunder this week. The Bulls have a really strong team with guys like Jimmy Butler, Derrick Rose and Pau Gasol, and they’re regarded as one of the favorites in the East this year. This one won’t be easy, especially on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sunday-november-8-at-600-pm-cst--vs-phoenix-suns&quot;&gt;Sunday, November 8 at 6:00 PM CST – vs. Phoenix Suns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Suns are 2-1 so far this season, but both wins came against a young and depleted Portland Trailblazers team. That being said, the Suns are certainly not a team that can be ignored, especially when their team features Eric Bledsoe and Brandon Knight, one of the better guard combos in the league. The Thunder will take Phoenix on after two days of rest, so here’s hoping fresh legs leads to a Thunder victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;three-things-to-watch-for&quot;&gt;Three Things to Watch for:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;point-guard-matchups&quot;&gt;Point Guard Matchups:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NBA has reached a point where point guard is arguably its strongest position, and the Thunder will bear witness to that this week. Thunder superstar Russell Westbrook will matchup against Ty Lawson, Kyle Lowry, Derrick Rose and Eric Bledsoe this week. These are all tough matchups in which Westbrook will have a lot of work to do on both sides of the court. Keep in mind also that Bledsoe is possibly the strongest defender of Westbrook in the league. Either way, the Thunder point guard is in for a tough week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fatigue&quot;&gt;Fatigue:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Including Sunday night’s victory against Denver, the Thunder is in the midst of a four game in five days stretch. The Thunder’s roster in extremely deep this year, and probably more so than it’s ever been, but that many games in five days is tough for any team. Hopefully the Thunder can get some big leads late like they did against the Nuggets, allowing the starters some much needed rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defense&quot;&gt;Defense:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder defense has allowed just under 112 points per game so far this season. Though it’s just been three games, and that number is inflated by the double overtime thriller against Orlando, the defense has left a lot to be desired. The good news so far is that the offense has been strong enough to allow the Thunder to come out on top, but this won’t likely always be the case. This defense needs to improve as soon as possible, and look for Billy Donovan and co. to start making some adjustments to enhance the team’s performance on that side of the court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;around-the-league&quot;&gt;Around the League:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some games around the NBA to watch for this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;memphis-grizzlies-at-golden-state-warriors--monday-november-2-at-930-pm-cst&quot;&gt;Memphis Grizzlies at Golden State Warriors – Monday, November 2 at 9:30 PM CST&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Western Conference is as deep as ever, and for that reason there’s typically at least one conference matchup per night that is worth a watch. The Warriors have started strong behind MVP Steph Curry, and are looking to build a repeat championship campaign. The Grizzlies are in the Western Conference conversation yet again this year as well, and this game surely won’t disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-york-knicks-at-cleveland-cavaliers--wednesday-november-4-at-700-pm-cst&quot;&gt;New York Knicks at Cleveland Cavaliers – Wednesday, November 4 at 7:00 PM CST&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago a game between these two teams wouldn’t be worth the two plus hours of your life, but this year is different. The Cavs are obviously a force to be reckoned with and the Knicks put together a solid team behind Carmelo Anthony this season. Plus there’s the whole Melo vs. LeBron rivalry that’s existed since they came into the league the same year. This should be fun to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;los-angeles-clippers-at-golden-state-warriors--wednesday-november-4-at-930-pm-cst&quot;&gt;Los Angeles Clippers at Golden State Warriors – Wednesday, November 4 at 9:30 PM CST&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two teams both enter the week undefeated, and they’ve looked good. They also have some history from the playoffs that has turned their matchup into one that’s always fun too watch. Both teams feature deep rosters behind some of the league’s top stars, so this game is sure to be a great one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;by-the-numbers&quot;&gt;By the Numbers:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section&quot;&gt;9&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of games it took the Thunder to reach three wins last season, with win number four coming in the sixteenth game. Nice to have that season behind us, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-1&quot;&gt;3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of three pointers James Harden has made in his first three games, in 32 attempts. That’s good for about nine percent from beyond the arc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-2&quot;&gt;62&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Points per game through three games for the duo of Westbrook and Durant. They’re undoubtedly the best duo in the NBA and are putting together a resume for best duo ever.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Eyeball Test: Nuggets @ Thunder</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;den-93---okc-117&quot;&gt;DEN 93 - OKC 117&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OKC needed a statement win, if not for rest purposes then to convince themselves they could shut down another team defensively from the tip. They got that win against Denver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those orange uniforms. The look really good on the court.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The defensive effort was so obviously better from the tip. It was also leading to transition points we’re used to seeing from this team, which is a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Serge Ibaka was all over this game. Powering inside, making his shots, and most importantly making his presence felt defensively.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ibaka’s chase down blocks were back. He looked back in rhythm for really the first time this season. He’s been making his shots all three games, and had some good defensive stops, but in terms of an overall game Serge finally looked like himself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was prematurely worried about Ibaka’s shot blocking. Not anymore. He had five blocks, and sat the entire 4th quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like the idea of Roberson starting, but his shooting consistency has not improved at all. After two bad shots and a lot of hesitations I started to wonder how long of a leash he has. He was pulled early in favor of Waiters, which seems to be Donovan’s preferred method of feeling out a game: start with your defensive starter that you know can’t shoot, and if he’s giving you nothing then sit him.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That being said, Roberson worked to earn his minutes as the game progressed. Defense to offense was a big part of the Thunder’s success against the Nuggets, and Roberson was hounding. He never takes plays off, and if he can move well off the ball to help the motion of the offense keep flowing he can still be effective enough at times where his defense will keep him on the floor. To be noted: as I took these notes on Roberson he nailed a 3-pointer to shut me up. He was all by himself in the corner, but it’s a start.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think Malone has a shot to make this Denver team overperform this season. They lack a lot of talent and have some injury problems, but Emmanuel Mudiay is a Rookie of the Year candidate, and that can’t hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Thunder in transition is so scary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Harden was on this team, it added another player who was deadly on the break. Thabo Sefolosha was also good in transition. Neither are on the team anymore, but Waiters has a chance to help bring another look outside of Westbrook and Durant when running the floor. His passing and newfound ability to finish at the rim could help the Thunder’s transition offense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nick Collison didn’t play last game despite the desperate need for defense. Against Denver he came in at the end of the 1st quarter and had his typical solid minutes. I’m still trying to figure out what Donovan sees as Collison’s role and strengths. When the Thunder are getting broken down inside doesn’t he give them an advantage, more so than with a transition happy, 3-point shooting team? It’ll be intersting to see how Collison’s minutes come moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kyle Singler is a foul machine. He had a great defensive stop and strip (block?) and then followed it up with a 3-pointer at the other end for a strong start to the 2nd quarter. Too bad he picked up three quick fouls and had to sit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3-point defense? I thought that was going to be a focus comng into the season. Randy Foye got was too many open looks for Denver. I suspect Coach Donovan isn’t too happy about that.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of focuses, wasn’t there supposed to be something about flopping in this league? I vaguely remember that. Seeing Danilo Gallinari reminds me of this everytime I see him.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Augustin has not had a bad game. He shot &lt;strong&gt;extremely&lt;/strong&gt; well, and continued to set up his teammates without turning the ball over. He continues to be very solid. Great pick up at the trade deadline, and maybe as important for this team as Enes Kanter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kanter didn’t see much of the court until garbage time (where he managed to pull off a double-double). It’s still so interesting learning who Donovan puts on the floor depending on who the opponent is and what is needed at that time. Scott Brooks achieved this through certain set lineups, which led to the perception that he was too stubborn and inflexible. Donovan seems to prefer subbing in one or two players at a time for more fluid adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the Thunder’s offense is working you don’t even notice it. There were 32 assists against the Nuggets, including four from Ibaka, which just seemed natural. The comfort level is rising with the new offensive sets, and that 2OT finish agaisnt the Magic seems to have done more good than just put Durant back in his rhythm. There were still the turnover issues, but things are smoothing out quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cameron Payne and Mitch McGary, a.k.a Campayne and McGOAT, saw their first minutes tonight. Payne had a nice steak and three good assists. He didn’t seem to have any rookie jitters or force anything to prove a point in the 4:30 garbage minutes he was given. McGary seemed a bit rusty. Hopefully he can shake the slight setback from his concussion quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good rest for the starters, sitting the entire 4th quarter, before heading to Houston without a day off.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;eyeball-test&quot;&gt;Eyeball Test?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confident and comfortable.&lt;/strong&gt; 30+ assists could be something we see regularly, and it seemed so natural. The defense stole the show and brought back the deadly transition offense this team is known for. It was also good to have Ibaka back to himself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Eyeball Test: Thunder @ Magic</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;okc-139---orl-136&quot;&gt;OKC 139 - ORL 136&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that just happened. I’m glad I was taking notes throughout the game, because I would have forgotten everything that happened before 30 seconds left in regulation after one of the most absurd 2OT finishes ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Roberson can’t shoot he at least has to be able to be active and pass the ball well. He threw it out of bounds enough times early to bring in Morrow to replace him.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of guards that can’t handle Westbrook’s size try to get under his skin (see: Patrick Beverly). Elfrid Payton was attempting just that last night, and it didn’t go so well for him. If anyone has the ability to hand out cheap fouls to his opponents it’s Westbrook, and he put Payton in foul trouble consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That pick and roll with Adams is so promising. You can tell he’s worked on rolling hard to the basket and getting ready for either Westbrook or Durant to hit him for a big finish at the rim.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very slow start. It’s the beginning of the season and it’s the Magic, but that was just bad. Donovan called a timeout and it appeared to be effective, giving the Thunder a burst. Sadly that burst didn’t last very long.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Augustin’s style of play is so important for this team. With the offensive weapons of Waiters and Kanter coming off the bench with him, the ability to collectively control the game and be a solid playmaker is so necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Donovan was looking for space, going small with Durant at the 4 and Kanter at the 5. The problem was there was absolutely no rim protection and the Magic kept hammering it into the paint. Even when Ibaka was switched out in place of Kanter the same problems persisted. Small ball defense is definitely a work in progress. (It worked late in the game, but there are still holes.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As sloppy as the the offense seemed it’s surprising how the Thunder were still able to score more than 50 points in the first half. The problem on this team is going to be its defense because even when it’s offense is struggling it’s still somehow effective.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Durant looked so much smoother. Remember this is from earlier in the game. He still seems a bit off on his timing, letting a pass fly right through his hands, but he’s rounding back into form quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That in mind, 53 minutes of playing (as long as it didn’t stress anything physically) looked to help Durant work out a lot of kinks, as he expressed post-game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Billy Donovan had a big motivation test coming out of the halftime break. Result? The defense definitely picked up in effort to start the third. Sadly, once again that didn’t last too long.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Waiter’s two big fadeaways at the end of the Spurs game seemed to boost his confidence in a big way. It showed against the Magic, which isn’t a good thing. Some things are better in moderation. He’s so much more effective when he plays within himself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every fast break that happens reminds me how little we’ve seen so far this season.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dion Waiters with the ball in his hands during crunchtime is so so stressful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KD is back.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Westbrook is ridiculous. He also &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; gives up. &lt;strong&gt;Never.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it bad that when he hit that nearly half court bank shot I actually thought it looked like a good attempt? Probably, but who cares.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seeing Joey Crawford reminds me that it’s his world and we’re just living in it. Then Westbrook did his thing, so please swap ‘Joey Crawford’ for ‘Russell Westbrook in that last sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monty Williams trying to corral the team back to the bench after Westbrook’s crazy 3-pointer was so amusing. Good luck with that Monty.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I only have a few things to note from the two overtimes. 1. Westbrook is unstoppable. 2. Steven Adams had some super feathery clutch free throws. 3. Durant left everything on the floor. He was dead tired, but pulled out some &lt;strong&gt;amazing&lt;/strong&gt; blocks to close out the game for an incredibly improbable Thunder win.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;eyeball-test&quot;&gt;Eyeball Test?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speechless but &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; worried.&lt;/strong&gt; Westbrook and Durant showed why they’re maybe the best one-two punch of all time. They were incredible. The rest of the team however didn’t contribute in a way that is sustainable, and that will need to be solved as quickly as possible. The defense was downright terrible, that is, until the Thunder decided they didn’t want to lose. Maybe it’s a motivation thing or as the season ramps up it will fix itself, but it’s been bad for the first half of both games so far.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Game Recap: Thunder vs. Magic</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;okc-139---orl-136&quot;&gt;OKC 139 - ORL 136&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that was a basketball game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder kicked off their road season tonight in Orlando against a young Magic team. And it was wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halloween came early when the television flashed a glimpse of Joey Crawford with the whistle. The game became even scarier as it got out of the Thunder’s hands early. But even though the Magic gave it their all tonight, no one was slowing down OKC’s big guns in Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder started positively with Ibaka shaking his opening night rust off by splashing a jumper. Early on, the Magic showed their intentions by grinding out a quick lead. The Thunder bigs were aggressive on the glass and distributed well, and KD racked up a quick 8 points. The defense was another story, however, and for the next three quarters the Magic’s bigs of Nikola Vucevic and Tobias Harris hounded the interior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orlando continued to build their lead in the second quarter while the Thunder struggled to get open looks to go down. It seemed to be one of those nights where shots weren’t going to fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vucevic was on fire. Sloppy offensive play and lacadasical interior defense saw the Magic jump out to a double digit lead.  Fumbled passes. More wide open looks missed. As the Magic’s lead jumped up to 15, one of the only positives was the bigs’ hard work giving second chances on the offensive end. Another was Westbrook aggressibely attacking the rim and baiting the opposing guards into foul trouble. Unfortunately, shots he usually makes weren’t falling, and to add to the struggles, the half ended with Waiters bouncing a wide open corner three off the side of the backboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder came out swinging in the third quarter looking to right the ship, but once again the Magic fired back. Second chance putbacks from the Magic became a regular occurrence. The team veteran, Evan Fournier, capped off a Thunder momentum killer with a 3-pointer to go up 16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then the Thunder reminded me what they do so frequently. They out athlete you. For the second time in two games, new coach Billy Donovan got another test on his tactical lineup management and adjustments his former counterpart was constantly questioned on. And he passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder had a big task to climb out of the 18 point deficient they found themselves in starting the fourth quarter. I had to ask myself “Did Kanter even play in the first half?” It may sounds strange, but I can understand Donavon watching his team get torched on the interior causing hesitation letting Kanter play big minutes. As the 4th quarter progressed, however, there didn’t appear to be any hesitation as Kanter’s stat line continued to grow. He was laying in easy an contested baskets, and challenged every rebound. He looked fantastic, and after the Thunder whittled the opponents lead to 10, Westbrook came up with a big steal and emphatic dunk to cut it to single digits. However, the Magic continued to answer everything the Thunder threw, especially by keeping plays alive with offensive rebounds. They even forced valuable time to burn off the clock by snagging a rebound on their own free throw miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down the stretch, the Donavon threw out an “unconventional” lineup. Durant and Westbrook spearheaded Augustine, Kanter, and Waiters to continue to fight. And fight. One thing became very clear: Westbrook wanted to win this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So he took it over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were several minutes left in the fourth (and two periods of overtime left), but Westbrook was not about to let the Thunder lose this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Durant nailed a cold blooded 3 to take the lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magic guard Victor Oladipo then appeared to seal the deal with his response to go back up 3 with seconds left and no timeout remaining for the Thunder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russell. Freaking. Westbrook. From five feet over half court he banked it in with less than a second on the clock. Overtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder go up to start overtime for the first time since their basket off the opening tip. The Thunder went back to small ball, with Adams replacing Kanter. They started strong, but soon tapered off, allowing the Magic back within reach. Roberson played spectacular defense, but Oladipo did it again, hitting an amazing shot. 2nd Overtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Durant was visibly tired by this point, ending the game with 53 minutes played, but he never gave up. Westbrook and Durant are too much to handle when they’re fully engaged, and this rang true for the youngsters of the Orlando Magic. They stayed close however, and Steven Adams was forced to hit two clutch free throws to go up four points and keep it out of reach. As the free throw game continued, however, Westbrook missed one and it was up to the Thunder’s defense to end the game. Durant came through big, blocking two consecutive 3-point attempts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder win. Breathe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was an unexpectedly uphill, difficult battle to fight, but the Thunder are 2-0 and already showing signs of how much they want this. They know very well what one game cost them last year. Credit to Russ for inspiring that fight and taking the game over. 48 points, and just 2 rebounds shy of a triple-double. Credit to KD for being the silky, smooth self he always has been, racking up 43 points of his own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there were obviously flaws in the game (little to no transition offense through 3 quarters, the berating by the Magic bigs in the interior, wide open 3-point looks for Oladipo and Elfrid Payton, and a porous defensive effort for three and a half quarters) there were positive takeaways. Donavon threw lineups out on the court to give the Thunder a chance, the end of the game play to spring KD up for a 3 ball to tie the game was executed beautifully, and the fight this team showed to tell the league theyre still the Thunder and they mean business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a couple of quick shoutouts. Gotta give it to Brian Davis. I hate blatant homer-ism, but it’s been a long offseason and it was great to hear him again. Also, Elfin Payton’s basketball skills are almost as awesome as his hair. I look forward to watching his future highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up:  Nuggets @ Thunder, Sunday, Nov 1.&lt;/p&gt;
