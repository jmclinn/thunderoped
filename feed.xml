        <title>Way Too Quick Overreaction</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bad&quot;&gt;The Bad&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this game was really bad. Tonight the Thunder dropped Game 1 to the San Antonio Spurs 124-92. There was exactly one good thing about tonight’s game. Serge Ibaka seemed to have found a little bit of an offensive rhythm. He finished as the high scorer for the Thunder with 19 points on 8-15 shooting. He even made 3 of his 6 attempts from beyond the arc. Unfortunately he got absolutely roasted by LaMarcus Aldridge on the defensive end. Aldridge finished with 38 points. He shot 18-23 meaning that he missed fewer shots than Cameron Payne took all game (6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook combined for 30 points - fewer than Aldridge - on 11-34 shooting. That equates to 32.4% shooting from the floor. Those types of numbers are reminiscent of Game 2 against the Mavericks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder had just four players score in double digits: Ibaka (19), Durant (16), Westbrook (14), and Waiters (11).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder had just three players with a positive +/- : Randy Foye (+6), Anthony Morrow (+5), and Nazr Mohammed (+3). None of them played more than 10 minutes. Foye logged exactly 10 minutes. Mohammed played 4 minutes, and Morrow played for 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LaMarcus Aldridge had a career day. Kawhi Leonard did Kawhi Leonard things and finished with 25 points on an unbelievably efficient 10-13 shooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A turtle had a better chance of guarding the pick and roll than the Oklahoma City Thunder tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fixes&quot;&gt;Fixes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we have to fix the pick and roll defense. Tonight it was absolutely atrocious. I have watched a lot of basketball, but never have I seen a team refuse to switch, or fight over a screen like this team. The Thunder half-ass hedge on the screen, but the hedge is never held long enough to make a difference. The slip is always open. If an actual effort is made by the on-ball defender then the pop or roll is always open. The scariest thing about the pick and roll defense tonight is that it is the same scheme and defense we played all season. Billy Donovan has not changed the scheme over 86 games. It is worrisome that he may not change it after the 87th and moving forward. This Spurs team is dangerous and these types of things cannot be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donovan should make a change in philosophy to either switch every screen or fight over every screen. The Thunder has the athletes to switch and effectively guard the pick and roll. The Thunder also has the interior presence to give up the drive off the pick and be able to alter a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-takeaway&quot;&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder played really terribly. It was probably the worst game they have played this season. They got absolutelly blown out by a veteran team that is coached by the best coach in the NBA. However, the Thunder still have two guys on the team who go by the names Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. KD and Westbrook will not allow this to happen again and will likely come out hungry and angry in Game 2 on Monday night. The real question that must be answered is whether or not Billy Donovan has the chops to make mid-series changes. He has to address the pick and roll defense at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forever and always, Thunder up!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This Series Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;last-series-for-the-san-antonio-spurs&quot;&gt;Last Series for the San Antonio Spurs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The San Antonio Spurs (67-15; 4-0) began their playoff journey this season with a 4 game sweep of the Memphis Grizzlies (42-40; 0-4). The closest the Grizzlies came to the Spurs was a 9-point loss in Game 3. The Spurs average margin of win was 22.5 points. It was mostly a defensive series, as you would expect from these two teams. San Antonio held Memphis to just 81 points per game - including a series low 68 points in Game 2. The Spurs managed to average 103 points per game. Kawhi Leonard was responsible for a little over 20% of the team’s scoring, as he averaged 21.5 points per game. The Spurs had just 3 other players to average double digit scoring during the series against the Grizzlies. LaMarcus Aldridge averaged 14.5 points per game. Patty Mills averaged 10.5 and Kevin Martin averaged exactly 10 points per game. Martin played in just two of the games in the series, however, and averaged just 14.5 minutes. In the Spurs complete domination of the Grizzlies, Zach Randolph and Lance Stephenson were the two highest scoring Grizzlies. The two averaged 13 points per game each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;key-players&quot;&gt;Key players&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thunder&quot;&gt;Thunder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;serge-ibaka&quot;&gt;Serge Ibaka&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serge Ibaka has always played a huge role for the Thunder in playoff series against the Spurs. Ibaka was injured going into the 2014 Western Conference Finals and the Thunder went down 0-2 in the series. Ibaka found a way to miraculously cure a Grade 2 strain of his left calf muscle and fought his way back to the line up. In his Game 3 return, Ibaka scored 15 points (6-7), pulled down 7 rebounds, and blocked 4 shots. The game staved off the threat of a sweep and energized the Thunder team who went on to tie the series 2-2 before ultimately falling 4-2 to the 2014 NBA Champion Spurs. In that series, Ibaka averaged 11.5 ppg, 5.3 rpg, and 3.3 blocks per game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This series the Thunder will need Ibaka to take advantage of the Spurs’ aging big men – Tim Duncan, David West, and Boris Diaw – and defend a player who will undoubtedly go down as one of the greats. His interior defense will be key to Thunder success as well. The Thunder will look to Ibaka (and Steven Adams) to alter Kawhi Leonard and Tony Parker’s shots in the paint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russell-westbrook&quot;&gt;Russell Westbrook&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder will need the all-star point guard to show up in a big way this series. The Spurs point guards do not stand a chance of being able to guard Westbrook for an entire game. Oklahoma City will look to Westbrook to take advantage of the opponent while Kawhi Leonard does his best to try to slow down Kevin Durant. Look for Westbrook to absolutely abuse Tony Parker early in games. He will likely take Parker down to the block and try to get some good looks early. It will force the Spurs defense to react and put some early pressure on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dion-waiters--enes-kanter&quot;&gt;Dion Waiters &amp;amp; Enes Kanter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bench combo will be crucial for the Thunder to be successful. If the Dion Waiters of Games 3, 4 and 5 shows up then the Thunder likely win the bench game against the Spurs. However, if Waiters plays like he did in Games 1 and 2 then the Thunder are in trouble. The Thunder needs Waiters to be able to take advantage of Manu Ginobili and win the battle of bench shooting guards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kanter is the anchor of the second unit. In four games this season against the Spurs, Kanter averaged 15.8 ppg and 14.8 rpg. The Thunder will desperately need him to keep up that level of play to have a chance in this series. The battle of the interior will go a long way in determining who will ultimately take this series. Look for Kanter to take advantage of smaller defenders from the bench unit. He is bigger, younger, and more active than either David West or Boris Diaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kevin-durant&quot;&gt;Kevin Durant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duh. He’s the face of the franchise and seeking to remind everybody that he firmly belongs in the discussion of best players on the planet. This could be a great series for him to make that claim. He will likely spend a good amount of time being guarded by the NBA Defensive Player of the Year. The Thunder needs Durant to wear Leonard down so that Leonard’s offense is affected negatively. It is difficult to guard one of the world’s best and score 20+ points in a game. The Spurs need both aspects of Leonard’s game to beat the Thunder. Durant has improved from game to game this season against the Spurs. He averaged 27 ppg, and 6.7 rpg. The most encouraging thing for Thunder fans is that Durant shot 46.9% from the floor. In each successive game he shot better from the floor and scored more points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spurs&quot;&gt;Spurs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kawhi-leonard&quot;&gt;Kawhi Leonard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As easy as it is for Thunder fans to dislike the Spurs, it is hard to dislike Leonard. The kid is a beast who excels at both ends of the court. He is the player that every coach wants to fill out his team. On the season he averaged 21.1 ppg, and 6.8 rpg, while also winning the Defensive Player of the Year award. He will be given the looming task of guarding Kevin Durant who will put Leonard through his paces. In&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;predictions&quot;&gt;Predictions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best chance for this Thunder team to win the series is to go 6 games. The Spurs were great at home this season and a Game 7 in San Antonio would be even more difficult. The Spurs and Thunder split the season 2-2 with both teams winning only on their home courts. The ideal situation is to win this one at home in Oklahoma City in Game 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two times that the Spurs and Thunder have faced each other in the playoffs the series has gone at least 6 games. This is the first time the two teams have played earlier than the Western Conference Finals and it is the first time the two teams have not been the top two seeds in the conference. It should be a fun series. The Thunder will have to break down one of the historically great defenses, but Oklahoma City has the talent to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forever and always, Thunder Up!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This Series in Review</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;scores&quot;&gt;Scores&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;game-1---oklahoma-city-thunder-108---70-dallas-mavericks&quot;&gt;Game 1 - Oklahoma City Thunder 108 - 70 Dallas Mavericks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;game-2---dallas-mavericks-85---84-oklahoma-city-thunder&quot;&gt;Game 2 - Dallas Mavericks 85 - 84 Oklahoma City Thunder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;game-3---oklahoma-city-thunder-131---102-dallas-mavericks&quot;&gt;Game 3 - Oklahoma City Thunder 131 - 102 Dallas Mavericks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;game-4---oklahoma-city-thunder-119---108-dallas-mavericks&quot;&gt;Game 4 - Oklahoma City Thunder 119 - 108 Dallas Mavericks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;game-5---oklahoma-city-thunder-118---104-dallas-mavericks&quot;&gt;Game 5 - Oklahoma City Thunder 118 - 104 Dallas Mavericks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;series-recap&quot;&gt;Series Recap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Oklahoma City Thunder won its first series in the 2016 NBA playoffs by a margin of 4-to-1. It was the team’s first foray into the postseason since the 2013-2014 playoffs when the Thunder lost to the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals. Much has changed since the Thunder’s last playoff appearance. Golden State was still an up and coming team that slid into the playoffs as a 6 seed. The San Antonio Spurs were the number one overall seed that season with Kawhi Leonard beginning to fully assert himself as the future of the franchise by winning the NBA Finals MVP. Oh, and some guy named LeBron James still had his talents resting in South Beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first series was a hard fought one that got chippy on both sides. For two teams that are so close in geographic proximity, there was definitely no love lost. Kevin Durant was assessed a Flagrant 2 and ejected near the end of Game 4 for a slap to rookie Justin Anderson’s face. Justin Anderson himself received a post-game Flagrant 2 for his actions during Game 5 when he dove elbow first into Russell Westbrook’s face in the waning seconds of the game. Raymond Felton deliberately threw an elbow into Steven Adams’s side while Adams was attempting to block Felton out. It’s not Steven’s fault that Raymond Felton looks like, and is about the same height as, a Big Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder overall played a strong series. In their four wins no game was closer than 11 points. The average winning margin for the Thunder over the Mavericks was 23 points per game. The one game that the Mavericks managed to steal from the Thunder was Game 2. The Mavericks took the game, in Oklahoma City nonetheless, by a narrow 85-84 margin. It took a historically bad night from Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, and a Steven Adams put-back that was 0.1 seconds too late to win on the road by just one point. In Game 2, Kevin Durant shot just 7-33 from the floor managing to scrape together just 21 points. Russell Westbrook was 8-22 for just 19 points; however, he did pull down 14 rebounds. This game was a fluke from the Thunder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real games to look at in the series are Games 1 and 3. The first game blowout makes sense looking at it in hindsight. While nobody predicted a 38-point blowout, everyone expected the Thunder to come out amped up. It was the first playoff game in 2 years and the Chesapeake Energy Arena was pumping. The Thunder could have come out nervous, but the core group of guys – Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, and Nick Collison – who were on the team during the 2012 NBA Finals run were not going to allow that. This season’s roster includes many young guys who had never previously been to the playoffs. Dion Waiters, Kyle Singler, and Anthony Morrow are the biggest names who have never been to the postseason. Along with them, the rookies, Cameron Payne and Josh Heustis, have also clearly never been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enes Kanter has been to the playoffs one time previously following the 2011-2012 season. However, this season is Kanter’s first extended exposure to playoff basketball. In 2012, his rookie season, he played four games in which the Utah Jazz were swept by the San Antonio Spurs. Kanter played just over 10 minutes per game that series. Kanter posted a double-double in his debut scoring 16 points, and grabbing 13 rebounds, while shooting a ridiculous 7-10 from the floor. The playoff rookie shooting guards – Dion Waiters and Anthony Morrow – did not fare as well in their debuts. The two combined for just 11 points on 2-12 shooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most encouraging sign from this game was the defensive intensity with which the Thunder played. They limited Dallas to just 70 points – a season low. Through the regular season the Mavericks averaged 93.8 points per game. The Thunder did well to force Dallas to miss shots. The Mavericks shot just 29.8% from the floor in Game 1 and just 22.2% from beyond the arc. This is the defense the Thunder needs in order to compete with the Golden State Warriors if the two teams meet in the Western Conference Finals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Game 3, the Oklahoma City Thunder offense absolutely erupted. The team scored 131 points tying a season high. The Thunder put 131 on two other teams this season. Both times occurred in wins on Dec. 29, 2015, against the Milwaukee Bucks (131-123) and on Feb. 9, 2016, against the Sacramento Kings (131-116). Game 3 saw Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook assert their dominance as two of the top players in the NBA. Durant scored 34 points in 37 minutes, while shooting 11-25. Kevin Durant shot 44% from the floor and that feels low. I think the guy is doing something right. He also grabbed 7 rebounds. Westbrook pitched in 26 points and 15 assists. Dallas did manage to slow down Westbrook’s rebounding abilities though. The Mavericks prevented him from pulling down a rebound in the game. The last time that happened was this preseason against Fenerbahce. The last time it occurred during a game that counted was April 17, 2013, against the Milwaukee Bucks when he played just 7 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kanter turned in another great game. He scored 21 points on 8-10 shooting, pulled down 8 rebounds, and blocked a shot, all in just 22 minutes of game time. This was a breakout game of sorts for Dion Waiters too. After shooting a combined 4-17 and totaling just 13 points in Games 1 and 2, Waiters broke out for 19 points on 7-11 shooting in Game 3. He even made 4 of his 8 3-point attempts. Waiters continued to play well through the end of the season logging double digit scoring nights in Games 3, 4, &amp;amp; 5 and shot 50% or higher in each of the three games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the type of offense the Thunder will need to bring if they want to beat the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Semifinals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serge Ibaka was absolutely huge in this series. The Serge Ibaka that showed up against Dallas was the Serge Ibaka that Sam Presti chose over James Harden. Ibaka finally looked like a member of the Big 3 for OKC again and it was refreshing. He was consistent through the first four games of the series, with a dip in Game 5. In Games 1-4, Ibaka averaged 15.25 ppg, 7 rpg, and 1.5 bpg. He shot 71.4% from the floor and 66.7% from 3-pt. range. Ibaka looked confident through theses games. Game 5 was a terrible regression. He scored just 2 points (made 2 free throws) and failed to score a basket in the run of play. Serge Ibaka always shows up in a big way for Oklahoma City when playing the Spurs in the postseason. He will be a crucial component to the Thunder’s chances for success in the conference semifinals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forever and always, Thunder Up!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This Week in Review</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;scores&quot;&gt;Scores&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;orlando-magic-117---114-oklahoma-city-thunder&quot;&gt;Orlando Magic 117 - 114 Oklahoma City Thunder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game was a lot closer than it probably should have been. The role players had, for the most part, terrible games. This was a game in which the stars carried the team. Kevin Durant had another great game scoring 37 points, 5 assists, and 5 rebounds. Durant had a strong shooting game from behind the arc making 6 of his 12 attempts. Russell Westbrook had a career night as well - just not in points or assists as we have become accustomed to seeing. Instead he set a personal best for rebounds. Westbrook pulled down 19 of them, while chipping in 24 points and 14 assists. Westbrook tallied the most rebounds of the game. Serge Ibaka was probably the biggest disappointment for the Thunder. He took 12 shots, making only 4 of them for just 9 points. He did pull down 7 rebounds and reject 6 shots, however. Enes Kanter provided some stability off the bench. He shot an efficent 6-8 for 13 points, while grabbing 7 rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Magic put in a team effort. Five players scoredin double digits. Victor Oladipo continued his progression as a good NBA player scoring 37 and 7 rebounds. The young guard dished out just 4 assists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oklahoma-city-thunder-108---116-golden-state-warriors&quot;&gt;Oklahoma City Thunder 108 - 116 Golden State Warriors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the game of the season for Thunder fans. It was one of the first true tests for the Thunder in testing their title credentials. Coming into this game the Thunder had won 18 of 21 and were playing some good basketball. The Warriors had blown out other teams the media selected as title contenders. Golden State beat the Cleveland Cavaliers by 34 and the San Antonio Spurs by 30. In terms of contenders, the media has begun to leave the Thunder off that list, but this game went a long way to firmly establishing them to be in the top tier of professional basketball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder got down early in the game. The second quarter was disastrous as the Warriors pushed the lead to more than 20 at one point. The Thunder fought back at the end of the quarter though and closed the game to just 12. The Thunder followed up the end of the second quarter with a strong third, its only winning quarter of the night, and closed the gap to 6 going into the fourth quarter. Anybody who has played basketball knows that comebacks are tiring and your legs begin to tire. This happened to the Thunder as they were unable to complete the comeback and ultimately lost by eight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook showed that they were not afraid of any duo, no matter the notoriety they may have or any cool nicknames they go up against. The two all-star starters outscored the Splash Bros. Durant dropped 40 points, had 14 rebounds, and 5 assists. Westbrook was effective in getting to the line and finished with 27 points and 12 assists. The Warriors did a good job of keeping Westbrook off the glass, however, as he only pulled down 3 rebounds. Enes Kanter was the surprise of the night for the Thunder. He scored 14 points in 20 minutes and grabbed 15 rebounds. He showed that he can play against the Warriors when it was commonplace to think he may not see the court in a game like this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Warriors got great performances from role players. Mareese Speights, Harrison Barnes, and Shaun Livingston combined for 44 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oklahoma-city-thunder-122---106-phoenix-suns&quot;&gt;Oklahoma City Thunder 122 - 106 Phoenix Suns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder firmly showed again that they would prefer to play just the first and fourth quarters of basketball games. This game got uncomfortably close in the fourth quarter, but then the Thunder remembered they just took the best 49 game team to the brink on the road. Kevin Durant led the team in scoring again putting in 32 points and grabbing 6 rebounds. Russell Westbrook had another near-triple-double - scoring 29 points, grabbing 8 rebounds, and dishing 8 assists. Dion Waiters, Enes Kanter, and Cameron Payne had productive games for role players. Waiters scored 15 points and dished 4 assists. Kanter and Payne led the bench by scoring 11 points each. Kanter pulled down 6 boards and Payne dished out 4 assists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder have affirmed that they are title contenders. The game against Golden State, while there is no such thing as a moral victory, was a huge statement. The Thunder took the defending champions, and the best 50 game team in the history of the NBA, to the brink. Another statistical point that is encouraging is turnovers. The Thunder have seemed to find a rhythm and are turning it over less. The negatives are that Serge Ibaka has yet to show up this season and he is an important part of the team. If this team is truly going to go the distance and give Golden State a test in the West then he needs to get involved and start knocking down shots. His 3 point percentage has declined each of the last 2 seasons and his field goal percentage is the second lowest of his career. The only season he shot a poorer percentage was last season when he was battling injuries for a good portion of the season and competing against defenses as the second option behind Russell Westbrook. He’s scoring fewer points than he has since the 2011-2012 season and he’s blocked fewer shots than any professional season except his rookie year. This team is already dangerous, with two top-five players, but if Ibaka steps up and elevates his game to a reliable level, this team will trade haymakers with Golden State for a trip to the NBA Finals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forever and always, Thunder Up!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;scores&quot;&gt;Scores&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oklahoma-city-thunder-126---123-minnesota-timberwolves&quot;&gt;Oklahoma City Thunder 126 - 123 Minnesota Timberwolves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game was a close one. The Timberwolves have some good young players and they played to their talent level against the Oklahoma City Thunder on this night. The Wolves also got some help from players you would not expect to have career type nights. Minnesota was led by Zach Lavine who finished with an absurd 35 points off the bench. Lavine only played 29 minutes but made 14 of his 17 shots. His only three misses were from behind the arc where he went 5-of-8. Lavine did not play a great team game however, as he finished with just one assist. Gorgui Dieng, the third year man out of Senegal, nearly tripled his career scoring average (7.9 points per game), and finished with 21 points and 9 rebounds. The young Minnesota transplants had impressive games as well. Rookie of the Year frontrunner, Karl Anthony-Towns showed why he is the frontrunner. The rookie logged a double-double with 19 points and 13 rebounds, while dishing out five assists as well. His second-year teammate, Andrew Wiggins, added 20 points to the total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Oklahoma City Thunder ultimately staved off the Wolves though and pulled out the victory. The Thunder relied heavily on Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, while Enes Kanter and Dion Waiters also turned in solid performances. Durant scored 27 points on ten-of-twenty shooting and pulled down nine rebounds. Westbrook scored 24 points on just 13 shots (making seven) and a generous 15 assists. He missed the triple-double by just two rebounds, finishing with eight. Kanter pitched in a double-double taking advantage of Minnesota’s young big men. He finished with 23 points in 23 minutes, and 10 rebounds. Getting the rare start at shooting guard, Waiters made the most of his opportunity and scored 16 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a weird game. Oklahoma City’s offense was clicking as it shot 52.7% (48-91) from the floor, 50% (10-20) from long distance and 95.2% (20-21) from the charity stripe. Putting up these numbers would typically be a blowout Oklahoma City win, however, Minnesota’s offense was clicking as well. The Timberwolves shot an outstanding 55.6% (50-90) from the floor. Free throws (64.3%) and the three-pointer hurt (35.7%) the team the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;houston-rockets-108---116-oklahoma-city-thunder&quot;&gt;Houston Rockets 108 - 116 Oklahoma City Thunder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is always a great win when it comes at Houston’s expense. Patrick Beverley’s shenanigans will never be forgotten and James Harden will likely never be forgiven. This game was never really as close as the scoreline indicates. After losing the first quarter 29-22, Oklahoma City bounced back and won the remaining three quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Durant had the best game for the Thunder, scoring 33 points and pulling down 12 rebounds. Russell Westbrook logged another triple-double. Westbrook scored 26 points, pulled down 10 rebounds, and dished out 14 assists. Dion Waiters logged another solid game as a starter. Waiters finished with 16 points for the second game in a row on an efficient six-of-nine shooting. Enes Kanter took Dwight Howard to the woodshed and finished with 22 points and 10 rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder played good defense this game, holding Houston to an abysmal 37.9% shooting from the floor. Houston was also terrible from the free throw stripe - largely due to Howard’s presence on the court. The team shot just 62.8% from the stripe. Howard was four-of-fifteen from the line. Harden made 15 of the teams 27 made free throws. The Thunder also limited the Rockets’ longball. Houston shot a laughably bad 23.1% from distance in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;washington-wizards-98---114-oklahoma-city-thunder&quot;&gt;Washington Wizards 98 - 114 Oklahoma City Thunder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is always nice to get an old fashioned blowout at home. The Thunder starters jumped out to a huge lead and the team never looked back. Four of the five starters scored in double digits - Dion Waiters had just eight points. Russell Westbrook got his second triple-double in a row in a game in which two premiere point guards were going head-to-head. Westbrook torched John Wall for 17 points, 13 rebounds, and 11 assists. Kevin Durant turned in another great game against his hometown team finishing with 28 points on 9/18 shooting while pulling down 9 rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest, and most welcoming, contribution of the night came from Serge Ibaka. The centerpiece of the Thunder defense has been up and down offensively this season, but this game he put it all together and showed just what he was capable of doing. Ibaka managed a double-double scoring 19 points on an impressing 8/12 shooting and pulled down 10 rebounds. It was good to see the Thunder big return to his offensive prowess. If he can continue knocking down shots and find a groove for the remaining 30 games of the season, he will be a huge boost to the Thunder’s offense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a strong week from the Thunder. The team went 3-0 (11-1 in the last 12 games) and improved its season record to 37-13. Oklahoma City is 13 games above Portland for first place in the Pacific Division. This week the Thunder will take on the Orlando Magic at home, the Golden State Warriors on the road, and the Phoenix Suns on the road as well. The game against Golden State on Saturday will be a huge barometer of where the Thunder currently is as a team.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This Week in Review</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;scores&quot;&gt;Scores&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sacramento-kings-116---104-oklahoma-city-thunder&quot;&gt;Sacramento Kings 116 - 104 Oklahoma City Thunder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not a great game for the Thunder. Kevin Durant was forced to sit out with a sprained toe that gave me concern when I first heard about it - anything dealing with Kevin Durant’s feet will elicit a heart attack from yours truly. While missing the former MVP and suffering a loss at home to the Kings there were a few bright spots. First, Serge Ibaka showed up in a big way. The big man from Congo scored 25 points on 10-17 shooting. Ibaka also pulled down 7 rebounds and swatted away 5 blocks. Anthony Morrow made the most of his opportunity to start in Kevin Durant’s place. Morrow finished with 20 points on an incredibly efficient 8-11 shooting. Russell Westbrook did not have a great scoring night managing only 17 points on a less than stellar 6-23 shooting. But he did finish with a double-double dishing out 15 dimes. He came up just short in the hunt for a triple-double though as he only pulled down 8 rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kings got some really solid games from guys that have proven they can play at a high level. Boogie Cousins scored 33 points and pulled down 19 rebounds while Rajon Rondo had 13 points and a ridiculous 19 assists. Rondo also swiped 5 steals. Marco Belinelli contributed 21 points on 6-13 shooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oklahoma-city-thunder-112---94-memphis-grizzlies&quot;&gt;Oklahoma City Thunder 112 - 94 Memphis Grizzlies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game was never really that close. The Thunder pulled away early and maintained a double digit lead through most of the second half. The greatest thing about this game was that Kevin Durant showed the toe injury was a one off and that he was back. He started slowly. The star forward began the game 2-10 from the floor. He turned it around in the second half shooting 7-8 and finishing with 26 points. Durant also pulled down 17 rebounds - a season high for him. Russell Westbrook returned to form and had another near triple-double. Westbrook scored 20 points, dished out 7 assists, and grabbed 7 rebounds. Dion Waiters broke out of his slump as well scoring 15 points on 6-9 shooting in an impressive 31 minutes played. Anthony Morrow, from the bench this game, made the most of his 18 game minutes. He continued his strong shooting season going 3-4 from the floor and 6-6 from the free throw line to score 14 points - nearly a point per minute. DJ Augustin was the only DNP - Coach’s Decision for the Thunder. Even Kyle Singler and Mitch McGary saw some game action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;trends&quot;&gt;Trends&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rotation&quot;&gt;Rotation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cameron Payne continues to be Russell Westbrook’s back up at the point guard position. He has surpassed DJ Augustin. Payne brings a jolt of energy and effort on defense - two things that are hard to honestly say about Augustin at this point in the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;last-10&quot;&gt;Last 10&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Record: 8-2
Average Points Scored: 112.2 
Average Points Allowed: 100.8&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forever and always, Thunder Up!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2015: A Thunder Year in Review</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2015th year of the Common Era has come to an official close. As we reflect on this past year, we should also take a moment to look back on the 8th calendar year of permanent NBA basketball in Oklahoma City, and the trials, tribulations, and times of the Thunder in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Injuries might be the unfortunate, but telling, place to begin the tale of the Thunder’s 2015. Kevin Durant had finally come back from his Jones fracture right before the new year turned over, and after a difficult start to the season, 2015 looked like the turning point for the team. The Jones fracture, however. Is a complicated injury even after surgery, and Kevin Durant was effectively shut down on February 19th after a 15 point win against the Dallas Mavericks. Durant had a second procedure on his foot shortly after that win. Serge Ibaka wasn’t immune to injuries either in 2015, as persistent soreness in his right knee led to surgical procedures that sidelined him for the last 17 games of the 2014-2015 season. The Thunder, without two of their big three, went 19-15 without Durant, and 8-9 without Ibaka in the 2015 calendar year, but were 10-5 with all three active. Sometimes fate has a way of changing everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team’s constant struggle with injuries last year led to new faces finding their way to the heartland and landing big spots on the roster and in the rotation. Dion Waiters landed in Oklahoma City on January 5 via trade, followed by Enes Kanter, Steve Novak, DJ Augustin, and Kyle Singler making their way to OKC via trade on February 19. Their impacts, especially last season, have been palpable, especially the play of Enes Kanter, who has solidified himself as one of the most talented centers to wear the Thunder logo. Cameron Payne, the rookie point guard out of Murray State, joined the team after being selected 14th overall in the NBA draft over the summer, and is quickly asserting himselfas a solid role player on this team. The new faces have brought a definitive new look to this team, while keeping the continuity of an already stout starting five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The front office also saw fit to make a move at Head Coach, bringing in the highly lauded Billy Donovan from the collegiate ranks at the University of Florida up to the big time in The Association. Donovan brought in Monty Williams and Mo Cheeks, among a few others, to strengthen his bench, while keeping some continuity, most notable Mark Bryant, the veteran big-man coach. Donovan’s professionalism and attention to detail, as well as his passion and ideologies were a great fit for what General Maneger Sam Presti had in mind, and the impression that Donovan and his coaching staff have made on the current roster and beginning to become very noticeable and especially positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roster and staff weren’t the only new looks that this franchise debuted in 2015. Oklahoma City unveiled 3 new uniforms, including another Christmas Day jersey, and continue to expand their brand with the likes of the Oklahoma pride and Sunset Sunday jerseys. Love or hate the new uniforms, creativity and ingenuity are some of the things that have been strong for this franchise, and this year was no different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder showed certain improvement over time through 2015, after a dismal 16-17 start to the 2014-2015 season, they went 29-20 through the first several months of 2015, and have posted a 23-10 record thus far in the 2015-2016 season. While a 52-30 (the Thunder actually played an exact full season’s worth of games in the 2015 calendar year) might not be the best calendar year in the Oklahoma City era, considering the challenges this team has faced, things are getting better every day. Kevin Durant has played in as many games this season as he did the entirety of last season. Russell Westbrook, who got married this summer and had his own signature shoe launch, has shown a great deal of maturity and poise, especially finishing last season without Durant and Ibaka. The year of 2015 may have been the first since 2009 that the Thunder missed the playoffs in a calendar year, but that hasn’t stopped them dead in their tracks. Hard work, and dedication have led to a consistent growth as a unit, and the future holds truly bright possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be remiss to fail mentioning that 2015 marked the 20-year anniversary of the Oklahoma City Bombing. While the players and staff make this franchise great, the strength of the fans and the city make it spectacular. This city and its people have showed great resiliency over the past 20 years, to come from a horrible tragedy to where we are now. The Oklahoma City Thunder are just a lasting reminder that this city can come together as one, hold up our neighbors through dark moments, and continue moving forward. The strong, vibrant city continues to grow and develop every day, and the Thunder have been an integral and lasting legacy of that genuine growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we head into 2016, let us reflect on 2015 with fondness. Learn from our mistakes, improve our own shortcomings, and cherish the wonderful moments. And, of course, keep Thundering up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thunder Weekly Forecast</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;games&quot;&gt;Games&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;monday-november-30-2015-at-700-pm-cst---at-atlanta-hawks&quot;&gt;Monday, November 30, 2015, at 7:00 PM CST - at Atlanta Hawks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another game against a former key Thunder player. Thabo Sefolosha is playing about 23 minutes per game for the Hawks and turning in a solid season. Serge Ibaka will have his hands full going up against Paul Milsap who is averaging a near double-double 19 games into the season. Milsap is putting up 18.2 points per game and pulling down 9.5 rebounds per game. This game will be shown on FS Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thursday-december-3-2015-at-600-pm-cst---at-miami-heat&quot;&gt;Thursday, December 3, 2015, at 6:00 PM CST - at Miami Heat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rosters are significantly different but the wounds still run deep for Oklahoma City fans. Any game against the Miami Heat brings back cringe inducing feelings. Lebron James has moved on to Cleveland, but Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh remain from the 2012 team that defeated the Thunder in the NBA Finals. Bosh is bordering on averaging a double-double by scoring 17.5 points per game and cleaning the class for an even 9 rebounds per game. Wade is beginning to show his age, yet still remains dangerous. He is scoring 17.1 points per game (would be his second lowest average of his career) and has seen his rebounds and assists per game decline over the last four seasons. This game will be televised on TNT and FS Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;three-things-to-watch-for&quot;&gt;Three Things to Watch for:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;road-struggles&quot;&gt;Road Struggles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Oklahoma City Thunder are only 3-3 this season in road games. The Thunder have one of the greatest home fan bases in the NBA, but true contenders must win on the road. This would be a good week to begin winning road games. The games are spread apart and there is not a lot of distance between Atlanta and Miami.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;serge-ibaka&quot;&gt;Serge Ibaka&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ibaka struggled in two back to back games earlier this month against the New York Knicks and New Orleans Pelicans. In those games he only scored 8 and 6 points respectively, while shooting 4-13 and 2-11. Since that New York game on November 20th, the Thunder big man has scored in double digits in 4 consecutive games. In those four games he’s averaging 13.25 ppg, 6.25 rpg, and 2.75 blocks per game. In this short burst he is shooting 57.1% from the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russell-westbrook&quot;&gt;Russell Westbrook&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Westbrook has only scored fewer than 20 points in two games this season. One of those games was Friday against Detroit. The other was against the Denver Nuggets – a game in which Westbrook played just 25 minutes. Following the Denver game, Westbrook bounced back against the Houston Rockets and scored 25 points, dished 11 assists, pulled down 8 rebounds. He did this on 10-16 shooting from the floor and 3-6 from deep. Westbrook should have another solid follow up game against Jeff Teague and the Hawks on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;around-the-leage&quot;&gt;Around the Leage:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some games that could be fun to watch around the NBA this week&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tuesday-december-1-2015-6-pm-cst--los-angeles-lakers--philadephia-76ers&quot;&gt;Tuesday, December 1, 2015 (6 PM CST) – Los Angeles Lakers @ Philadephia 76ers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not going to be a great display of NBA basketball, but it will feature Kobe Bryant’s shell and some good young big men in Julius Randle, Nerlens Noel, and Jahlil Okafor. But most important to this game is that it might be Philadelphia’s last serious chance to end their notorious losing streak. This game can only be seen locally in the respective markets or on NBA League Pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thursday-december-3-2015-830-pm-cst---san-antonio-spurs--memphis-grizzlies&quot;&gt;Thursday, December 3, 2015 (8:30 PM CST) - San Antonio Spurs @ Memphis Grizzlies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rematch of the 2013 Western Conference Finals could be interesting. Memphis is 6-4 in their last 10 games and seem to be gradually figuring things out. The Spurs are, well, the Spurs. They’re sitting at 14-3. This game will be shown on TNT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;saturday-december-5-2015-6-pm-cst---cleveland-cavaliers--miami-heat&quot;&gt;Saturday, December 5, 2015 (6 PM CST) - Cleveland Cavaliers @ Miami Heat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cleveland Cavaliers @ Miami Heat – Lebron James makes another return to Miami to play against old friends Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade. This game will be shown on NBA TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;by-the-numbers&quot;&gt;By the Numbers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section&quot;&gt;115.3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder are averaging 115.3 points per game on the road this season. This is higher than the season long average of 109.4 points per game. However, they are giving up 110.3 points per game compared to the season average of 102.8 points per game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-1&quot;&gt;13&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder have scored 100 points or more in 13 games this season. Only Golden State (18) has more such games. Atlanta has only surpassed 100 points 9 times this season. Miami has only scored 100 in 3 games so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-2&quot;&gt;47.7&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of rebounds on average that the Thunder pull down per game. This is the best rate in the NBA. Miami ranks 10th with 45.2 rebounds per game, and Atlanta ranks lowly at 28th pulling down just 41.2 boards per game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forever and always, Thunder Up!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This Week in Review</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;scores&quot;&gt;Scores&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oklahoma-city-117---114-dallas&quot;&gt;Oklahoma City 117 - 114 Dallas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a solid win for the Oklahoma City Thunder. In the, hopefully final, game before Kevin Durant’s return, the Thunder knocked off the Dallas Mavericks. It was another Sunset Sunday. The Thunder moved to 3-1 on Sunset Sundays at the Chesapeake Energy Arena. Russell Westbrook had his customary double-double on 31 points and 11 assists. He also had 5 steals and 5 rebounds. The Thunder also got solid performances out of Serge Ibaka, Dion Waiters, Nick Collison, and Anthony Morrow. Perhaps the biggest shift for the rest of the season came with the emergence of Anthony Morrow. Head Coach Billy Donovan was forced into playing the 3-point specialist due to Kevin Durant’s injury and Morrow finally made the most of the opportunity. He finished with 14 points on 5-9 shooting (2-3 from long distance) in 24 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oklahoma-city-111---89-utah&quot;&gt;Oklahoma City 111 - 89 Utah&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Durant made his return from the hamstring injury in this road game, which was the second game of a back-to-back. He showed that he can pick up right where we expected him too. The former MVP and four time scoring champion finished with 27 points on a ridiculously efficient 10-13 shooting (3-6 from distance) while also pulling down 6 rebounds, swiping 4 steals, and blocking one shot. Anthony Morrow again seized his opportunity finishing with 15 points on 6-8 shooting (3-4 from distance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oklahoma-city-110---99-brooklyn&quot;&gt;Oklahoma City 110 - 99 Brooklyn&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the Kevin Durant’s return to the Chesapeake Energy Arena after his hamstring injury. He did not disappoint. Durant had another efficient night scoring 30 points on 11-18 shooting (5-8 from distance). He grabbed 6 rebounds and dished out 5 assists as well. Russell Westbrook pitched in another double-double scoring 27 points on 10-16 shooting while dropping 13 dimes. Dion Waiters had another solid performance tonight scoring 16 points on 6-13 shooting. Anthony Morrow had a down game with just 6 points on 2-5 shooting. Serge Ibaka hopefully had a game that can get him going on the season. He finished with 12 points on an efficient 4-9 shooting. Ibaka made all of his free throws (4-4) and pulled down 8 boards as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;overall-thoughts&quot;&gt;Overall Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a really good week for the Thunder. Kevin Durant returned from his injury, which hopefully will not linger. The team picked up three wins: one against a good team, one against a mediocre team, and one against a bad team. All three count the same in the win column though. The Dallas win was the most impressive of the week. The Mavericks are the best team Oklahoma City played this week and they were streaking. The Thunder ended the Mavericks’ six game win streak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly the most interesting thing to happen this week, outside of the Thunder having a full starting line-up again, is the return of Anthony Morrow to the rotation. He played an average of just over 22 minutes per game this week and seemed to relish the opportunity and thrive in the positions in which he was put.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;up-next&quot;&gt;Up Next&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder take on the Detroit Pistons on Friday, November 27, at the Chesapeake Energy Arena. Reggie Jackson will be back in town. Then The Thunder take on the Atlanta Hawks on Monday, November 30, in Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forever and always, Thunder Up!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Eyeball Test: Mavericks @ Thunder</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;dal-114---okc-117&quot;&gt;DAL 114 - OKC 117&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder showed some grit after giving up a 10 point lead in a 20 point swing for Dallas, but came back and held on to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the tip, the Thunder finally looked like a team again. Defense still a struggle, which is confusing, but it looks like they’re trying again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Waiters lost the ability to hit a layup about two games ago. Don’t know where that went.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rotation for this game may have been Donovan’s most reasonable to date. Instead of trying to get struggling guys going, this team needed to get going as a whole so Morrow and Collison saw meaningful minutes and helped the Thunder win.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Singler does try. Sometimes too hard, and control is a definite skill. Two fouls on the same possession is not helpful, and when he catches the ball on the perimeter it’s not going down. He tries, but he’s got to get better before giving him significant minutes makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Payne? Interesting, but good to see. Knocks down a midrange with confidence. Had some rookie mistakes and two mishaps with Ibaka on fast breaks, but I like the potential and the fact that he’s getting meaningful minutes here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of confidence, Ibaka looking better. Throughout the game it came and went, and he still seems a step off on defense. His confidence looked better though. His block on Deron Williams to help seal the win was vintage Ibaka, but prior to that he was making some silly fouls. His one on one defense mostly held up, however, so hopefully Ibaka keeps trending in a positive direction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kanter commanded a double team, and instead of trying to power through he passed out to an open Morrow for an easy catch and shoot three. Great to see.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deron Williams had a surprising amount of space throughout the game when guarded by Westbrook. He even blew by Westbrook on one drive. Westbrook locked in a lot more toward the end of the game and looked like he was trying throughout, but in the pick and roll Deron was getting easy looks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did Williams really trip himself and get awarded a clear path foul? Yeah, that just happened.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing the Thunder has to get over is the collapse that happens every game. In the 3rd quarter, after a 8-0 Dallas run, the Thunder were all of a sudden down 10 and having to dig themselves out of a hole.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The officials couldn’t make up their minds during the game. They went from calling everything, to calling nothing. I understand each game will be called differently, but having no consistency in what is getting called is ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the defense picks up the scoreboard goes in the right direction. By the end of the 3rd the Thunder had pulled out of their hole to have a 2 point lead heading into the 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Morrow hitting nice floaters in the paint. Great to see him get going.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is it with this team and not following plays down the court? Waiters chased down Wes Matthews, causing him to miss what would have been easy fast break points. The Mavs still got an easy two points though, because no other Thunder players followed the play. All four were still on the other side of the half court line.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The adjustment period for this team seems so slow. It took several straight losses for them to start hitting a stride originally. Then when Durant went down the wheels fell off the bus, and it took 5 more games for the Thunder to look like a team again. The defense still has to get better, but it’s a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;eyeball-test&quot;&gt;Eyeball Test?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In sync.&lt;/strong&gt; They still collapsed, but they came back and played some good defense late to seal a win against a surprisingly decent Dallas team.&lt;/p&gt;
