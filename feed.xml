        <title>Game Recap: Thunder vs. Spurs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a game mostly controlled by the San Antonio Spurs, the Thunder was able to come out on top in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most matchups between these two teams, the game stayed pretty close throughout, though it seemed as though the Spurs were in control for the majority of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder got off to a rough start offensively, while the Spurs settled into an early rhythm. The Thunder was getting a lot of open looks, but early on they were not falling. However, thanks to Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant, who combined for 18 first quarter points, the Thunder lead 29-27 at the end of the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second quarter was the Thunder’s worst quarter, and it was during this quarter that the Spurs really seemed in control. They did this with great defense, forcing 11 turnovers and only sending the Thunder to the free throw line for three attempts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the Thunder struggled in the second quarter, there were some bright spots in D.J. Augustin, Dion Waiters and Enes Kanter, who all played well in their first half minutes. Augustin and Waiters were both making smart decisions and Kanter was a beast on the glass as usual, tallying six points and eight rebounds in the first half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the Spurs defense was solid in the first half, the Thunder still shot 50 percent, though they were just 3-11 from beyond the arc. After one half the Thunder were down 55-50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third quarter featured both teams trading runs for the bulk of the quarter, with Westbrook carrying the Thunder, while Durant’s offense sputtered due to some tough defense from Kawhi Leonard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kanter continued his success in the third, reaching the double-double plateau after playing just 17 minutes. Ibaka, who struggled in the first half, found some rhythm in the third quarter as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder would eventually win the third quarter by a point, making the score 83-79 in favor of the Spurs after three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spurs controlled the fourth quarter for a while, but the Thunder was able to hang around due to some timely buckets by Westbrook, Kanter, Anthony Morrow and Steven Adams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around the four-minute mark the Thunder seemed to be taking control of the game, and though it would remain close until the end, the Thunder would not be held back. Waiters hit two big jumpers late, and Westbrook added a huge clutch three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after a Leonard and-1 the Spurs were down by just two. They got the ball back with about 20 second remaining, but Danny Green launched an ill-advised prayer, giving the Thunder the chance to put the game away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder would hit the late game free throws to finish the game off, and won with a final score of 112-106.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Durant scored 22 but struggled most of the game, and was noticeably outmatched by Leonard. He got a lot of good looks but never found a consistent stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Westbrook finished with 33 points and 10 assists and Kanter finished with an impressive double-double of 15 points and 16 rebounds. The rest of the scoring was refreshingly balanced, with four more guys with eight points or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder will hope to carry some momentum form this big win into its Friday night matchup with the Orlando Magic.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kevin Durant Season Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Kevin Durant, who is coming off a disappointing and injury riddled season, will look to return to his MVP form during the 2015-16 season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Durant played in just 27 games last season, and though he averaged solid numbers with 25.4 points, 6.6 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game, he was unable to help the Thunder reach the playoffs due to his lingering foot injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year Durant appears to be healthy and ready to help the Thunder compete for a championship again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some things to look for in Durant’s ninth NBA season:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;health&quot;&gt;Health&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-28/durant1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt; Kevin Jairaj – USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is clearly the biggest concern for Kevin Durant this season. Before last season’s 27 games, he had never played less than 66 games in a season. Historically he has been healthy, and Thunder fans and NBA fans in general have to hope that last year was a fluke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Durant played well in the preseason, and he looked as though he hasn’t lost a step. All signs point to him being healthy now, and it seems as though his most recent operation was a lot more successful than the first two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Durant can stay healthy, the Thunder should be one of the best teams in the NBA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;leadership&quot;&gt;Leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-28/durant2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt; Mark D. Smith – USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Durant is just 27 years old, but behind Nick Collison and Steve Novak, he is the third most experienced player on this Thunder roster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Durant’s experience consists of six all-star appearances, 73 playoff games and one well-deserved MVP trophy. Needless to say, he has to be a leader on this team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder has a lot of young players, including Steven Adams, Andre Roberson, Dion Waiters, Cameron Payne and Mitch McGary, who could all be important parts of a Thunder championship run. These guys will need a lot of guidance, and Durant is one of the best guys to provide it. He’s really developed his game over the years to make himself more than one of the league’s top scorers, and his expertise can certainly be used to mold some of his young teammates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look for Durant to have a strong leadership role on this young but talented Thunder roster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dominance&quot;&gt;Dominance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-28/durant3.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt; Soobum Im – USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Durant’s last full season was his incredible 2013-14 MVP campaign, and Thunder fans should be optimistic that a healthy Durant can return to that season’s level of dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Durant is at his best, there’s only one player that can give him a run for the title of best player in the world, and the gap between him and LeBron James was certainly closing before last year’s injury. This year Durant will look to pick up where he left off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his 27 games last year, Durant put up good numbers and shot 51 percent from the field, 40 percent from beyond the arc and 85 percent from the free throw line. Though his season was short, these numbers put up with lingering injury problems give just a small taste of Durant’s potential. He’s capable of greatness, and the only thing that can hold him back at this point is injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A healthy Durant is the second best player in the world, and at times a case could be made calling him the best. This year he will look to return to his dominant MVP form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-28/durant4.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt; Steve Mitchell – USA TODAY Sports &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Durant’s season last year was cut way short, and it was a shame to watch as the Thunder was unable to reach the playoffs without him. This season should end with a very different outcome, as Durant should help the Thunder contend for an NBA championship.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Harden Trade Review: Rebuttal</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Berry Tramel of the Oklahoman just wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;http://newsok.com/harden-trade-becomes-less-tolerable-with-each-passing-year/article/5456260&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; claiming the trade that sent James Harden to Houston exactly three years ago has become “less tolerable” as the years have passed. He poses that due to the lack of championship rings in OKC, Sam Presti failed. That keeping Harden for his contract season, without an details on what could have happened had he left town on another team’s max offer sheet, would have been superior to three seasons of injuries leading to two playoff series losses and whatever you want to call last year. It now lies in “what-might-have-been land”. So let us go there for arguments sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-we-value-a-trade&quot;&gt;How do we value a trade?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, however, what goes into valuing a trade? Circumstance changes everything, and the championship aspirations of the OKC Thunder can’t be ignored. Yes, Harden is probably the best shooting guard in the NBA today. Yes, star power decides championships. Had Harden been a malcontent, unhappy with his role, Sam Presti could have sent him to Houston, and the narrative would have been filled with ‘locker room cancer’ talk. This was never even close to the case, but James Harden did believe in his abilities and was never going to become the James Harden we see today had he remained in OKC. As his mother put it &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/13869848/rockets-guard-james-harden-found-place-excel-show-strengths-houston&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“He would never get the ball playing with Kevin and Russell… Now he’s in Houston. And he’s shining.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the trade initially happened the Thunder obtained players, namely Kevin Martin, and three draft picks. They set themselves up financially for the future to re-sign Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, remain under the cap to go after potential free agent role players, and those draft picks had deadly potential in the hands of Sam Presti and his staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Thunder extended Ibaka and Harden continually said that he wasn’t involved with his contract negotiations, leaving them up to his agent, it was the first signs that Presti could potentially pull the trigger. He did. The Thunder have since had two key injuries during playoff series that have resulted in the only playoff series losses since they reached the Finals with Harden. One of Tramel’s two main points is that Harden would have been able to stem the tide of Westbrook going down at the hands of Patrick Beverly. That would have left the bench depleted, and the Thunder needed all three of their stars as was demonstrated when Harden disappeared in the 2012 Finals. So we can’t value a trade by what might have happened. We have to look at what it gave versus what it would have given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;harden--adams-mcgary-abrines-and-more&quot;&gt;Harden = Adams, McGary, Abrines, and more…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Martin left town a year later, Jeremy Lamb never panned out and is now looking to make a name in Charlotte. Those three draft picks turned into Steven Adams, Mitch McGary, and Alex Abrines. They are what we have to dissect the trade. We have to ignore Martin’s departure and the absurd cap rise. We have to be fair to the moment and what assets are currently making an impact for OKC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harden would have never been the Harden we know today. If he was, his openly clear aspirations to win MVP could very well be tearing a rift in a locker room of a team trying to mesh under a new system. Harden wasn’t in OKC to surpass Westbrook or Durant. He was the sixth man meant to rip apart opposing benches. It was a clear strength for a team that struggled with overall depth, especially in the front court. OKC brought in the ghost of Kendrick Perkins as an improvement to its inside defensive presence, and in the years since has routinely switched out its backup center. When Eric Maynor tore his ACL he was never the same. Reggie Jackson was Maynor’s replacement, but he was more in the mold of a Westbrook or Harden than a Maynor. He could drive and finish, and has shown the ability to take over games for short stretches. He needed the ball in his hands to be effective, and with Harden in town this would have never happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harden runs the Houston offense through himself much as he ran the Thunder’s second unit. Reggie Jackson filled that role. He didn’t replace Harden, but he filled his role. He wouldn’t have become the player he is today with Harden still in OKC. With those opportunities, no matter what you think of Reggie Jackson’s abilities, he was able to command a major contract as well as send significant trade pieces to the Thunder. Those pieces included Enes Kanter and D.J. Augustin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also included in the Reggie Jackson trade was Kendrick Perkins. He and Nick Collison were the only consistent big man for the Thunder until Steven Adams was drafted with one of the draft picks from the Harden trade. Adams learned quickly from Perkins on the defensive end, and his added athleticism has allowed him to become the starting center of the Thunder. He is a solid defender, is improving his catch for pick and role finishes, and has a decent hook shot. His development is one of the primary reasons the Thunder were comfortable sending Perkins away for Kanter. Without Adams and cap flexibility the Thunder may have been forced to keep what remained of Perk out of sheer necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder also felt comfortable keeping Kanter, because even with his contract they will be able to sign Durant in free agency while avoiding the repeater tax. Having Harden’s contract on the roster, even as the cap inflates next year, hurts the limited flexibility the team has. The past few seasons free agent signings have been rare, but acquisitions like Anthony Morrow wouldn’t have been possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This team’s depth has been growing steadily due to the repercussions of losing Harden. McGary is a future impact player with a very nice offensive skill set already. Alex Abrines can hit shots from deep and is still gaining experience playing in Europe. Those are two of the three draft picks the Thunder received for Harden, and they are either on the fringe of the rotation or half the world away because of how deep this team is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair to Berry Tramel, the fact that all the trade pieces haven’t had time to show their full return yet was acknowledged in his article, albeit in passing. He didn’t, however, take into account that major superstar injuries end playoff runs no matter who you are, and because the Thunder traded James Harden they have been able to put together their deepest team yet. They have the flexibility to re-sign their three stars and the depth to push for not just one, but multiple championships in the immediate future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future is bright. The Houston Rockets gained a superstar, but the Thunder have the better team. And it’s sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t gauge the value of a trade simply because a team has had crippling injuries and hasn’t won a championship. There are no guarantees in this league.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kyle Singler Season Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-26/singler1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Rick Scuteri - USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyle Singler was scouted by Sam Presti during his time at Duke. He’s the role player with length that Presti likes, and so he was brought over in the trade deadline unloading of Reggie Jackson last season. When he reached OKC he was asked to slip into the starting small forward spot during a dumpster fire season plagued by unrelenting injuries. Things didn’t go so well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things we’re looking for Kyle Singler to improve on this season:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shooting&quot;&gt;Shooting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before reaching OKC, Singler was shooting 40 percent from the field, with nearly identical percentages from both 3- and 2-point range. It was the result of a steady climb in field goal percentage his first four seasons. Then he was traded and the floor fell out. Technically his 3-point shooting only took a 3 percent hit, but from inside the arc his shooting dropped to 28 percent. In 456 minutes, with 18 games starting, he only made 32 field goals on a team struggling dearly for offense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pressure of having to replace Kevin Durant would be daunting for anyone, which is understandable, and learning a new system mid-season can be tricky. It’s still a fascinating drop in production, however, and one neither Singler nor the Thunder can afford this season. In the preseason his field goal percentage has risen back to above 40 percent, but that’s preseason and he’ll need to get even better than that to help out his team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defense&quot;&gt;Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singler hasn’t looked comfortable. Maybe that’s just how he appears, but if there’s one area he can’t afford to be lost on, it’s defense. He was brought in to replace Roberson one game in the preseason after Roberson picked up two quick fouls. In the ideal scenario Singler can come in and show some semblance of the same defensive tenacity, while also aiding in offensive spacing. Until Huestis is ready (if that ever happens), Singler is really the only wing defender with the size and mobility to take Roberson’s place without relying on Durant to buckle down defensively while also doing what he needs to on offense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory he’s a great piece for the Thunder, but until he shows differently the memory of last season’s unecessary and constant fouling remains scary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hair-quotes-and-stability&quot;&gt;Hair, Quotes, and Stability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this offseason Singler time travelled to the early 2000’s and brought back his new hair style. He then supplied some &lt;em&gt;strange&lt;/em&gt; quotes during media day. When asked why Sam Presti had been raving about him, he replied “I haven’t been to any raves with [Presti].” It’s an odd thing thing to say, but we’ll let it all slide. Why? Because we need stability from Singler more than we need him to make any sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a big year for the franchise. There are quite a few question marks on this team, but Singler is one piece who’s intended purpose is that of the glue. He seems to know and like his role, so let’s just hope he follows through on that with a return to form that is stable and accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Nick Collison Season Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-26/collison1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Nick Collison - Instagram&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Collison is entering his 12th season in the NBA. He has spent his entire career with the same franchise and has seen the franchise go through a change in location, mascot, and color scheme. Collison has always been a fan favorite in Oklahoma City due to his hard hat, blue collar working attitude and willingness to make the hustle plays. Collison’s focus for the last several years has been defense and rebounding. It will be interesting to see what role he plays this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things to look for from Nick Collison this season:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hustle&quot;&gt;Hustle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-26/collison2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Bryan Terry - The Oklahoman&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Collison might be the definition of a hustle player. Collison has never cracked double-digit averages in scoring during his long career. You do not stick around the league without scoring unless you are able to do a lot of other things well. Nick Collison is that player. He rebounds the ball well and will always take the extra dive to save a loose ball from going out of bounds. Nobody will soon forget the post season when it seemed like Collison was constantly bleeding from his face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defense&quot;&gt;Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-26/collison3.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Andy Lyons – Getty Images North America&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collison has never been a scoring machine in the NBA. The most points he averaged in a season was in the 2007-2008 NBA season – the last season in Seattle, for that matter. Last season he averaged only 4.1 ppg and shot just 41.9% from the field. These are both new lows, with his shooting performance being by far the worst of his career. But the good news is that the Thunder do not rely on Collison for his offense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with countless other things that he does for the Thunder organization, Collison brings tenacious defense to the team. He has served as the resident defender when playing guys from Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol to guys like Thiago Splitter and Chris Andersen. He knows how to get under guys’ skin. It seems he passed that ability down to Steven Adams as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mentorship&quot;&gt;Mentorship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-26/collison4.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Steven Adams - Twitter (@RealStevenAdams)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Derek Fisher settled into the head coaching role in New York City, Collison is now the resident veteran on the Thunder. The team is not a bunch of kids like it was in 2012. Guys like Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant are now seasoned players and you have to think that being around Collison helped them grow as professionals as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player most like Collison on today’s roster is Mitch McGary in terms of outlook and ability and things that both players do well. However, Collison and Steven Adams have a buddy bromance that is the most fun non-basketball thing to follow for this team. Collison has taught Adams the ability to anger other big men without getting in trouble himself. Collison’s fingerprints are on the team. On a personal note – I cannot wait to hopefully one day see him healthy on the Thunder bench yet wearing a suit as a coach.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;games&quot;&gt;Games&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wednesday-october-28-at-700-pm-cst--vs-san-antonio-spurs&quot;&gt;Wednesday, October 28 at 7:00 PM CST – vs. San Antonio Spurs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder will start the season with a tough home game against the ever-dangerous Spurs. There are plenty of storylines to watch in this game: Kevin Durant’s return, LaMarcus Aldridge’s Spurs debut, and legendary coach Gregg Popovich vs. rookie Billy Donovan. The Thunder would love to start the season with a big victory, and this game should prove to be a great one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;friday-october-30-at-600-pm-cst--at-orlando-magic&quot;&gt;Friday, October 30 at 6:00 PM CST – at Orlando Magic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game two comes on the road against the Magic, a young team with a lot of talent in guys like Victor Oladipo and Nikola Vucevic. This Magic team is no slouch, but the Thunder should be able to overpower them and take a victory on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sunday-november-1-at-600-pm-cst--vs-denver-nuggets&quot;&gt;Sunday, November 1 at 6:00 PM CST – vs. Denver Nuggets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder’s final game of the week falls on Sunday, against Denver. The Nuggets are not likely to be very good this year, and new head coach Mike Malone certainly has his work cut out for him. This game should be a pretty easy victory for the Thunder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;three-things-to-watch-for&quot;&gt;Three Things to Watch for:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-return-of-kevin-durant&quot;&gt;The Return of Kevin Durant:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who hasn’t been looking forward to this since April? Durant is coming off a season ruined by his foot injury, and will look to bounce back to his 2013-14 MVP form. Everyone is nervous that his foot problems will linger, but fans have a reason to be optimistic after watching him play like the Durant we know and love in the preseason. So long as he is healthy, Durant should have no problems returning to dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;billy-donovan&quot;&gt;Billy Donovan:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Thunder’s new coach will begin the season with high expectations. Scott Brooks was fired at the end of last season, following the Thunder’s first time missing the playoffs since the 2008-09 season. Brooks was unable to get the Thunder over the hump and win a championship, and the Thunder decided to gamble on a rookie coach in Donovan. He had plenty of success coaching at the University of Florida, and is highly regarded, so the hope is certainly that he can take the Thunder to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;offense-vs-defense&quot;&gt;Offense vs. Defense:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems to be no question that the Thunder offense should be deadly, with the likes of Durant, Russell Westbrook, Enes Kanter, Serge Ibaka, Dion Waiters and Anthony Morrow all available as scoring options. The questions, however, lie on defense. The Thunder have some great defensive players like Ibaka, Steven Adams and Andre Roberson, but on the other hand they have guys like Kanter and Morrow, who struggle on the defensive end. The first unit defense should be good, but a second unit that features both Kanter and Morrow may struggle on that front. It’s certainly something to look out for as the Thunder opens the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;around-the-league&quot;&gt;Around the League:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some games around the NBA to watch for this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cleveland-cavaliers-at-chicago-bulls--tuesday-october-27-at-700-pm-cst&quot;&gt;Cleveland Cavaliers at Chicago Bulls – Tuesday, October 27 at 7:00 PM CST&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of two games that will kick off the two 2014-15 season, and is quite possibly an Easter Conference Finals matchup preview. It’s certainly early to call something like that, but both of these teams should be very good this year, and this game will be a good one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dallas-mavericks-at-los-angeles-clippers--thursday-october-29-at-930-pm-cst&quot;&gt;Dallas Mavericks at Los Angeles Clippers – Thursday, October 29 at 9:30 PM CST&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who doesn’t love some NBA drama? Clippers center DeAndre Jordan bailed on his Dallas contract this offseason, and luckily for NBA fans, they are set to meet in week one. The Clippers are no doubt better than Dallas, and should win, but the drama behind this matchup should make it entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;golden-state-warriors-at-houston-rockets--friday-october-30-at-830-pm-cst&quot;&gt;Golden State Warriors at Houston Rockets – Friday, October 30 at 8:30 PM CST&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reigning champs with their MVP Steph Curry will take on MVP runner up James Harden’s Rockets. Both of these teams are title contenders this year, and this game should be fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;by-the-numbers&quot;&gt;By the Numbers:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section&quot;&gt;10.2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amount of rebounds Ibaka has averaged against the Spurs in his career. It’s the only team he’s averaged double-digit boards against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-1&quot;&gt;502&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amount of college wins for Coach Donovan. He’ll hope to continue his success in the NBA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-2&quot;&gt;18.1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dion Waiters’ career points per game against Orlando, the most he’s averaged against any team. He’s also shot 47 percent against the Magic.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Serge Ibaka Season Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Serge Ibaka, who’s coming off yet another solid season in an Oklahoma City Thunder uniform, will look to continue his success in his seventh NBA season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Ibaka missed time due to injuries in the 2014-15 season, he still put up solid numbers, averaging 14.3 points, 7.8 rebounds and 2.4 blocks per game. His overall field goal percentage went down, but this was due to his increased three point shooting. He made about 38 percent of his threes though, which is very good, especially for a rim protecting power forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some things we’re looking for in Serge’s 2015-16 season:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;health&quot;&gt;Health&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-25/Ibaka 1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Mark D. Smith – USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ibaka has dealt with injuries for two straight seasons, with his 2013-14 injury coming at a crucial point in the playoffs. It’s no secret that the Thunder was a constant victim of the injury bug last season, and the hope this year is that this will not be the case, especially for players like Ibaka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ibaka plays a crucial role on this team, providing great input on offense, defense and rebounding. The first two games of the 2013-14 Spurs series shows that the Thunder aren’t likely to succeed without a healthy Ibaka, so hopefully he is able to complete this season without any issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ibaka did not play in FIBA EuroBasket 2015 this summer, so he should be well rested and ready to contribute to a new and improved Thunder squad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defense&quot;&gt;Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-25/Ibaka 2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Robert Hanashiro – USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense has always been one of Ibaka’s strengths. He started as an incredible help defender and rim protector, and over the years has expanded to be a pretty solid on the ball defender as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing is different this year: Ibaka has never played significant time next to another big like Enes Kanter, who struggles so much on the defensive end. This may see Ibaka’s defensive responsibilities increase, as the Thunder coaching staff is likely hoping that he can help pick up some of Kanter’s slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody should be worried about Ibaka’s defensive abilities, as he’s proven himself time and again on that end of the court, but his defensive workload might be something to look out for this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scoring&quot;&gt;Scoring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-25/Ibaka 3.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Anthony Gruppuso – USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder has never had so many offensive weapons at once, with a squad consisting of Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Dion Waiters, Anthony Morrow, Kanter and Ibaka. That doesn’t even include guys like D.J. Augustin and Mitch McGary, who certainly have some offensive abilities as well. What this should mean for Ibaka is plenty of open looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect a lot of Ibaka’s scoring to come from his midrange game, which is undoubtedly one of the best in the league, and expect him to shoot quite a few threes again too. Ibaka’s expanded range has made him even more valuable on offense, and It should be easy for him to put up some points this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With only so many shots to go around, Ibaka may not up his overall scoring numbers, but he should have plenty of chances to score with ease, and he should be an important part of the Thunder’s new offensive onslaught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-25/Ibaka 4.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Rick Scuteri – USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder is a much better team with a healthy Ibaka, and that’s what they hope to get this season. Ibaka should be an important part of the team yet again, and should post another successful season in Thunder blue.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cameron Payne Season Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As with most rookies drafted onto a team fighting for a championship, the story of Cameron Payne his rookie season will be how and if he carves out a role. No one is taking Russell Westbrook’s spot and D.J. Augustin defines ‘solid’ as a backup floor general. If Payne hopes to find minutes for himself he’ll need to shake off the rookie jitters and show what he brings that Augustin can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He are a few things that we are keeping an eye on with Payne this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;calm--control&quot;&gt;Calm / Control&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-24/payne1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Jim Brown – USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rookies make mistakes. Rookie point guard mistakes stand out. When the ball is in your hands and you dribble it off your foot, or you pass behind yourself on a fast break to no one in particular, people notice. Moving past these moments and learning from them will be crucial to Payne’s place on the roster this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has the skills and experience operating with all the eyes on him from his time at Murray State, but both the metaphorical and literal bright lights and sounds of the NBA add their own distractions. Payne is fighting for a roster spot with a player in D.J. Augustin who has stuck in the league because he knows what he brings. He’s not long and athletic. He is however, a solid shooter and passer. He fits in and does his job without standing out. Payne is athletic and a much more exciting player, but his rookie season will be best served mimicking the intangibles of Augustin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calm and collected play is a necessary element for a backup point guard, especially one that would be taking the floor with Enes Kanter and Dion Waiters. There’s already enough offensive flash to go around. Payne’s personality is anything but subtle, but for him to grab hold of a spot in this rotation he’ll need to make sure he isn’t shaken when staring down the Chris Pauls of the league.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;minutes&quot;&gt;Minutes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-24/payne2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Sue Ogrocki - Associated Press&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first look at Payne had a lot of people, myself included, locking him in to play rotation minutes by at least the All-Star break. Even if the excitement reasonably tapered off as some rookie mistakes set in, there are still ways he could receive regular minutes this season. Two point guard lineups were fairly common under Scott Brooks, and having three point guards all receiving minutes was the norm in past seasons with Westbrook, Reggie Jackson, and Derrick Fisher on the roster. If Billy Donovan sees advantages to those lineups too it could be one way Payne sees minutes without leapfrogging Augustin’s spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing standing in Payne’s way, however, is that Mitch McGary may deserve the minutes more. He can pass, attack, rebound, and has proven he can spark this team back to life. Depending on Collison’s play and how rotations work themselves out McGary may be the better bet to crack a rotation and receive currently invisible minutes that Payne is hoping to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Payne will receive minutes in garbage time. If he can make the scrubs pay like Jeremy Lamb never could it could help his case. There’s a chance Westbrook may sit during some back-to-backs against the bottom of the East (or the Lakers), and this frees up minutes for Payne. Barring injuries, these games may be the best chance Payne has to prove himself in an actual game situation when the points really matter. Sitting Westbrook isn’t a definite thing, but keeping its stars fresh and healthy for the post-season is one of the Thunder’s main objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot is up in the air, and the most surefire way to crack the rotation is to take Augustin’s spot. That, however, will require Payne to bring something special…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-does-he-bring&quot;&gt;What Does He Bring?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-24/payne3.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Charles Rex Arbogast - Associated Press&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Blue/White Scrimmage, Cameron Payne came out guns blazing. He was knocking down his 3-pointers and floaters, manipulating his defender, and hitting his man for wide open shots. Then the preseason moved out of the highschool gym and into the NBA arena and Payne came down to Earth. No one forgot the explosive edge he brought, however, and he’s still a pass-first point guard that isn’t just looking to get his.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Payne to get rotation minutes he’ll have to do more than show maturity and calm beyond his years and experience. The Thunder already has that player in Augustin. He’ll also have to bring something beyond consistent shooting, because Augustin isn’t an unknown there either. Payne is going to have to bring something special that really opens up other facets of Coach Billy Donovan’s offense. If he can collapse defenses attacking the paint, beat his man off the dribble, move well off the ball, and be a reliable pest on defense then Payne has a rotation spot. It may be just one or two of these points, but he’ll need to figure out where his strengths lie and how to use them effectively while also matching Augustin’s strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-24/payne4.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Brad Penner - USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder aren’t going to leave anything to chance, because they both can’t afford and don’t have to with the proven players on this roster. Cameron Payne has the talent to take the backup spot for his own. The only question is whether he can put it all in place do to so in this pressure cooker season.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>D.J. Augustin Season Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;D.J. Augustin, an underrated part of the Reggie Jackson trade last season, will look to continue his success as a backup point guard in the 2015-16 season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Augustin played just 28 games with the Thunder last season, and though he didn’t particularly shine, he brought smart and solid play to the Thunder’s second unit. In 24 minutes per game, he averaged 7.3 points and 3.1 assists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He are a few things that we are looking for with Augustin this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;minutes&quot;&gt;Minutes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-23/Augustin 1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Sue Ogrocki – The Associated Press&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Augustin will begin the season as the Thunder’s backup point guard, but unlike last season, he may end up with some competition for that role. Cameron Payne, the Thunder’s first round draft pick out of Murray State, is a highly regarded rookie who will no doubt be looking to climb the depth chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Payne actually outplayed Augustin for the most part in preseason, and though that won’t necessarily be characteristic of the season, it’s something to look out for. The Thunder certainly drafted Payne with the future in mind, but who knows if that future will come sooner than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another scenario is Payne and Augustin sharing time, but considering they’ll be backing up Russell Westbrook, there won’t be a lot of minutes to go around. It’ll be interesting to see who holds the backup job by the end of the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assists&quot;&gt;Assists&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-23/Augustin 2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Sue Ogrocki – The Associated Press&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Augustin has never been an assist machine by any means, but in his time with Oklahoma City last season he just averaged 3.1 assists per game, down almost two from the 4.9 he was averaging in Detroit in about the same amount of minutes played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Augustin will likely see most his minutes with guys like Dion Waiters, Anthony Morrow and Enes Kanter, and this should give him plenty of opportunities to find open shots for his teammates. He can be a big part of a second unit that may be a defensive nightmare, but that should be able to score with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look for Augustin to do some more distributing and up his assist numbers this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shooting&quot;&gt;Shooting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-23/Augustin 3.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Soobum Im - USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Augustin is a career 40 percent shooter, but shot just 37 percent with the Thunder last season. This includes about 35 percent from three, down from his career percentage of 37.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Augustin is not anywhere near the top of the list when it comes to Thunder scoring options, but he’s got to be able to score when open, and it would be excellent to see him hover around 40 percent from three, a number he’s eclipsed a few times in his career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Augustin shot about 27 percent in preseason, and only made one 3-pointer in 10 attempts. Shooting like this may find him in a position with less minutes, so it will be interesting to see how he can improve as the regular season opens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-23/Augustin 4.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Sue Ogrocki – The Associated Press&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Augustin is a smart player who should continue to succeed as a backup point guard, and as long as he is able to keep his place on the depth chart, he should provide some positive contributions for the Thunder this season.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Anthony Morrow Season Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In his second season in Oklahoma City, 3-point sharpshooter Anthony Morrow will look to continue the success he saw in his first year as a member of the Thunder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morrow, arguably one of Sam Presti’s best free agent signings to date, led the Thunder in 3-pointers (141) and 3-point percentage (43 percent) last season. He averaged 10.7 points in 24.4 minutes per game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morrow has really flourished in his role with the Thunder so far, and there’s no reason to think he won’t continue his success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some things we’re looking for with Morrow this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;minutes&quot;&gt;Minutes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-22/Morrow 1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Chris Humphreys-USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Morrow’s success last year, he should still see plenty of minutes this season, but there may be less minutes to go around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A healthy Thunder will have three shooting guards, Morrow, Dion Waiters and Andre Roberson, who will likely see regular minutes. The Thunder will also probably feature a two point guard set from time to time, with Russell Westbrook and D.J. Augustin, and perhaps Cameron Payne. Kyle Singler is likely to get some minutes too, though these will most likely come from backing up Kevin Durant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see how new head coach Billy Donovan mixes and matches lineups, but hopefully the Thunder’s depth won’t keep Morrow from succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;big-games&quot;&gt;Big Games&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-22/Morrow 2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morrow’s always most likely to hover around 10 or 12 points per game, but last season he showed that he’s capable of getting hot and going off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morrow eclipsed 20 points six times last season, including a season high of 32 in a loss against Dallas. This isn’t the norm, but it should happen again considering the amount of open looks he should get with the Thunder’s deep offensive repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morrow is always a fun player to watch, but when he gets on a roll he is virtually unstoppable. While this won’t happen every game, look for him to have some really strong performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;energy&quot;&gt;Energy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morrow is one of the most energetic players in the NBA, and he is always very excited when he succeeds or sees his teammates succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy isn’t something that shows up in the box score, but it contributes a lot to a team’s morale, and is great for sparking rallies. When watching Morrow, whether he’s on the court or on the bench, it’s easy to see that he loves the game and really wants his teammates to succeed. He wants to win, and he’s not afraid to show it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s Thunder squad should be really fun to watch, and there’s no doubt that Morrow and his energy will contribute to the entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morrow had a lot of success in his first season with OKC, and this year we are hoping to see much of the same from the 3-point sniper.&lt;/p&gt;
