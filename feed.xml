        <title>Steven Adams: Quotes, Pics, and GIFs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Steven Adams - Nick Collison summer bromance continued two days ago when the Thunder did a slightly New Zealand themed sitdown with the two. Also, before we get going here, all the quotes and images were taken from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nba.com/thunder/news/collison_adams_1510&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; available on the Thunder website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;framing-the-shot&quot;&gt;Framing the Shot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever encuntered any of the guys on the team in real life they aren’t the shortest people in the crowd, but some people are taller than others. Nick Gallo is looking short already, and it doesn’t help when Adams appears to be sitting in a high chair that doesn’t quite fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-09/8.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin:0 auto;max-width:500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hair-v-hair&quot;&gt;Hair v Hair&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve’s hair is always good for a discussion, but with Nick Collison there for comparison the Kiwi deferred to the elder statesman when asked “Who has the better hair?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-09/2.gif&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin:0 auto;max-width:500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adams: The classic comb-over. Tell them about your comb in the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collison [reluctantly]: I’m the only player to have a comb in the bathroom…in Thunder history…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adams: No, his is absolutely classic. Mine is just messy and gross. All over the place. I’m like the wild little brother. He’s the civilized human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-recurring-green-drink&quot;&gt;The Recurring Green Drink&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what fascinated me about this, but Adams makes it great. In comparison to him it looks absurdly small, and based on his reaction I’m not quite sure he’s supposed to be drinking it on camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-09/3.gif&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin:0 auto;max-width:500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But nonetheless he keeps going back in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-09/7.gif&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin:0 auto;max-width:500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;receiving-praise&quot;&gt;Receiving Praise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Collison says Adams is “going to be really good” and that he’s already “good now” Adams has to cool off his blushing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-09/4.gif&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin:0 auto;max-width:500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He got so flustered he had to be reminded where the camera was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-09/5.gif&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin:0 auto;max-width:500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stealing-the-show&quot;&gt;Stealing the Show&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Collison is a smart dude with insightful answers, but what are you supposed to do when this guy is next to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-09/1.gif&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin:0 auto;max-width:500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-09/9.gif&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin:0 auto;max-width:500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calm and collected isn’t Adams’ style unless he’s getting under an opposing player’s skin on the court. This series of photos all took place within about 10 seconds of each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-09/6.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin:0 auto;width:95%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very curious to know who was off to Adam’s right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;never-ending-quotes&quot;&gt;Never-Ending Quotes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since Adams &lt;a src=&quot;http://newsok.com/article/5376283&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;relayed&lt;/a&gt; his welcome to the NBA moment involving Perkins a.k.a “The Only Silverback”, you have to be on quote and story alert. The man never fails to disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(on the new coaching staff)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adams: One thing that stuck out is Monty’s family. He’s got a large offspring. Just a lot of kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(on Adam’s Castaway Halloween costume)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collison: You had a FedEx box, and didn’t you pack sandwiches in the box that you could eat throughout the night?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adams: That’s a marathon. I have to be prepared. So I put the sandwiches in the FedEx box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collison: And he was just sneaking them the whole night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bromance&quot;&gt;Bromance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You always hear Russell Westbrook is a really goofy dude, but Adams never hides it. These guys are having fun, and you have to love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good to have Steven back on the floor, and here’s to more laughs and bone-crushing screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-09/10.gif&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin:0 auto;max-width:500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2015-16 Season Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There were some huge changes this offseason that will have profound impacts on the future of basketball in Oklahoma City. There were changes at the top of the coaching staff along with an unfortunate amount of physical therapy and surgeries. But the future is bright again in Oklahoma City – and it is not just from the absolute star that Russell Westbrook has grown into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most exciting thing that happened for the Thunder this offseason was Kevin Durant receiving a clean bill of health and returning to regular basketball activities. With high expectations going into the 2014-2015 NBA season, Durant and Oklahoma City received terrible news. He would be diagnosed with a Jones’ fracture. He was initially expected to miss 6-8 weeks but this injury is tricky and Durant was shut down midway through the season, only appearing in 27 games that also included a nasty ankle sprain. Durant has had nearly a full season off and this could be a good thing. He has had a year of rest and rehab and should be back to his old Durant form. Even in limited action last season he averaged 25.4 ppg on 51% shooting while pulling down 6.6 rpg and dishing out 4.1 apg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If his preseason interviews have been any indication, Durant fully expects to return to his MVP winning caliber play. The free agency rumors will be ridiculous and we should all just settle in and get used to them. If Durant’s spat with Stephen A Smith is any indication, Durant is fired up, angry, and still not nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-6/kdnotnice.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;KD Is Not Nice: Property of Nike&quot; title=&quot;KD Is Not Nice: Property of Nike&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:25%;width:50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to getting an MVP back to full health, the Thunder made coaching changes as well. Gone are the days of Scotty Brooks and the countless radio call-ins claiming a new coach would be the saving grace of Oklahoma City basketball. We will find out this year under the newly hired helm of Billy Donovan. Coach Donovan has long been a favorite among college coaches expected to make the jump to the pros. He attempted it one time getting hired by the Orlando Magic, but quickly changed his mind and returned to the University of Florida. The man has a great track record of winning. He has accomplished nearly everything in the amateur game and expects to do the same in the NBA. His coaching and system have put a number of players into the Association and many of them have had success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donovan brings significant change to the thunder offensive scheme. Durant will spend less time on the ball running pick-and-rolls. The scheme relies on spacing and ball movement – seemingly the opposite of the Brooks system. This change will take pressure off of both Westbrook and Durant. The spacing should help our high number of jump shooters and should prove to be fun to watch. Durant will get more open jump shots and Enes Kanter and Serge Ibaka should continue to show off their mid-range touch. The most excited player about the change might be Anthony Morrow. He was absolutely fire from 3-pt range last season and should have even more space to operate this year (not that the fastest trigger in the West needs much space to get a shot off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be some familiar faces on the sidelines with Donovan. Though they will not be the main face of the staff this year, the assistants Donovan and Thunder GM Sam Presti have assembled are quite impressive. He will have two former NBA head coaches on the bench with him to help adjust to the length of the NBA season. Monty Williams, fresh off of a playoff season in New Orleans, will make the move to Oklahoma City and slide down the bench a spot. There is a familiar face to Thunder fans as well as Maurice Cheeks joins the Thunder staff for a second time. Many of us remember Cheeks being on the bench under Scotty Brooks when Oklahoma City won the Western Conference Finals and played the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals. The two Thunder assistants have combined to win 478 NBA games. There is another former college coach making the jump to the NBA too as OKC welcomes Anthony Grant to the bench. Grant was formerly a head coach at the University of Alabama and Virginia Commonwealth University. The Thunder also welcomes back Royal Ivey who played in Oklahoma City from 2010-2012, and in 2014 on a 10-day contract. Ivey was a member of the NBA Finals team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Russell Westbrook proved to the rest of the league last year what Oklahoma City already knew. He is a true superstar. Westbrook and Durant give the Thunder two of the top five NBA players in the same starting line-up. Many people will talk about how they will be unable to co-exist. “Russell is too ball dominant. He does not understand he is not the star.” Those people are wrong. Westbrook is a playmaker and has to have the ball in his hands to do that. Sure, he sometimes gets tunnel vision, but we all saw last year that he is capable of going 1-on-5 and making special things happen. Throw Durant on the court and things open up even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a fun season for all Oklahoma City fans. This is the deepest roster assembled to play at the ‘Peake. There is a new coach eager to prove he belongs. We have an MVP returning who wants his name back in the discussion for best player in the Association, and a point guard who is absolutely terrifying when he is pursuing a goal. Steven Adams and Serge Ibaka will protect the paint while Andre Roberson harasses other guards on the wings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second unit will be more than serviceable when the starters need a breather. Kyle Singler looks to regain his long distance form while Dion Waiters will continue to create. DJ Augustin will put the second unit guys into positions to succeed. Nick Collison and Steve Novak, with shrinking minutes but increasing locker room rolls will provide tutelage for the young guys Mitch McGary, Josh Heustis and Cameron Payne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The season is near. Get up. Get loud. Get excited.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Thunder&#39;s New Challenge</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenge&quot;&gt;Challenge.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t think of a better word to describe both the charge and approach of OKC Thunder coach Billy Donovan. This team is established, the pecking orders are set, and the players know their roles. Scotty carved the game board and whittled the pieces, crafting with care despite all the noise. Now it’s Donovan’s turn to set the pieces to the board for maximum output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the last day of April coach Donovan has been watching film. Who goes where and why? How to learn from how Brooks utilized his assets and how to grow from there. All the soundbites suggest the Thunder’s new coach didn’t arrive with any preconceived notions and believed his first job was to learn about his new team. From what we saw at the first public appearance of the 2015-16 Thunder, I’m inclined to believe no smoke had been blown. At the annual Blue and White Scrimmage, based on the limited quotes and video clips available, two of the most quoted lines coming from the Thunder and Donovan over the past few months are what stood out the most: A focus on spacing and schemes that maximize unique player strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Billy Donovan says Dion Waiters has underrated passing abilities and the box score says Dion Waiters led the game with 8 assists it appears he might be on to something. When the Thunder are seen running this play I’m sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-video&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Watch: Highlight from the Blue &amp;amp; White: Westbrook to Collison to Durant to Zanna. &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/krEneZBjCP&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/krEneZBjCP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; OKC THUNDER (@okcthunder) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/okcthunder/status/650813679361875968&quot;&gt;October 4, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet to be fair, it’s beyond early to make any lasting assumptions, and the last defensive domino to fall on that play featured Enes Kanter in quicksand. Anyone could say what works for Durant won’t work for Singler, as Donovan has previously, but when newly drafted Cameron Payne causally flips the ball into the hands of 3-point specialist Steve Novak for a game winning buzzer beater it shows not only the coach’s understanding of everyone involved but a willingness of the players to trust the play. A scrimmage is a scrimmage. The lights, sounds, and pressure of an NBA game change everything, but the future looks promising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This team is stacked, and expectations are always sky high. The national media will scream about a ‘closing window’, as they have for three seasons. Westbrook will still shoot the ball amidst continued rumblings that this simply detracts from Durant’s greatness. Durant free agency noise will reach fever pitch, but one challenge standing before the Thunder is a different kind of challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year wasn’t Team-KD versus Team-Russ as it was in years past. It was starters versus the bench. The individual greatness and leadership is now in hand, so cohesion has its chance to step forward. It’s what GM Sam Presti saw in the chance to hire Donovan, and it’s now Donovan’s job to see it through. This challenge isn’t one the Thunder face, but an opportunity they now possess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Steven Adams, get better man…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check back soon for 2015-2016 season previews!&lt;/p&gt;
