        <title>Eyeball Test: Thunder @ Magic</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;okc-139---orl-136&quot;&gt;OKC 139 - ORL 136&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that just happened. I’m glad I was taking notes throughout the game, because I would have forgotten everything that happened before 30 seconds left in regulation after one of the most absurd 2OT finishes ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Roberson can’t shoot he at least has to be able to be active and pass the ball well. He threw it out of bounds enough times early to bring in Morrow to replace him.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of guards that can’t handle Westbrook’s size try to get under his skin (see: Patrick Beverly). Elfrid Payton was attempting just that last night, and it didn’t go so well for him. If anyone has the ability to hand out cheap fouls to his opponents it’s Westbrook, and he put Payton in foul trouble consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That pick and roll with Adams is so promising. You can tell he’s worked on rolling hard to the basket and getting ready for either Westbrook or Durant to hit him for a big finish at the rim.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very slow start. It’s the beginning of the season and it’s the Magic, but that was just bad. Donovan called a timeout and it appeared to be effective, giving the Thunder a burst. Sadly that burst didn’t last very long.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Augustin’s style of play is so important for this team. With the offensive weapons of Waiters and Kanter coming off the bench with him, the ability to collectively control the game and be a solid playmaker is so necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Donovan was looking for space, going small with Durant at the 4 and Kanter at the 5. The problem was there was absolutely no rim protection and the Magic kept hammering it into the paint. Even when Ibaka was switched out in place of Kanter the same problems persisted. Small ball defense is definitely a work in progress. (It worked late in the game, but there are still holes.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As sloppy as the the offense seemed it’s surprising how the Thunder were still able to score more than 50 points in the first half. The problem on this team is going to be its defense because even when it’s offense is struggling it’s still somehow effective.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Durant looked so much smoother. Remember this is from earlier in the game. He still seems a bit off on his timing, letting a pass fly right through his hands, but he’s rounding back into form quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That in mind, 53 minutes of playing (as long as it didn’t stress anything physically) looked to help Durant work out a lot of kinks, as he expressed post-game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Billy Donovan had a big motivation test coming out of the halftime break. Result? The defense definitely picked up in effort to start the third. Sadly, once again that didn’t last too long.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Waiter’s two big fadeaways at the end of the Spurs game seemed to boost his confidence in a big way. It showed against the Magic, which isn’t a good thing. Some things are better in moderation. He’s so much more effective when he plays within himself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every fast break that happens reminds me how little we’ve seen so far this season.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dion Waiters with the ball in his hands during crunchtime is so so stressful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KD is back.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Westbrook is ridiculous. He also &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; gives up. &lt;strong&gt;Never.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it bad that when he hit that nearly half court bank shot I actually thought it looked like a good attempt? Probably, but who cares.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seeing Joey Crawford reminds me that it’s his world and we’re just living in it. Then Westbrook did his thing, so please swap ‘Joey Crawford’ for ‘Russell Westbrook in that last sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monty Williams trying to corral the team back to the bench after Westbrook’s crazy 3-pointer was so amusing. Good luck with that Monty.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I only have a few things to note from the two overtimes. 1. Westbrook is unstoppable. 2. Steven Adams had some super feathery clutch free throws. 3. Durant left everything on the floor. He was dead tired, but pulled out some &lt;strong&gt;amazing&lt;/strong&gt; blocks to close out the game for an incredibly improbable Thunder win.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;eyeball-test&quot;&gt;Eyeball Test?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speechless but &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; worried.&lt;/strong&gt; Westbrook and Durant showed why they’re maybe the best one-two punch of all time. They were incredible. The rest of the team however didn’t contribute in a way that is sustainable, and that will need to be solved as quickly as possible. The defense was downright terrible, that is, until the Thunder decided they didn’t want to lose. Maybe it’s a motivation thing or as the season ramps up it will fix itself, but it’s been bad for the first half of both games so far.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Game Recap: Thunder vs. Magic</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;okc-139---orl-136&quot;&gt;OKC 139 - ORL 136&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that was a basketball game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder kicked off their road season tonight in Orlando against a young Magic team. And it was wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halloween came early when the television flashed a glimpse of Joey Crawford with the whistle. The game became even scarier as it got out of the Thunder’s hands early. But even though the Magic gave it their all tonight, no one was slowing down OKC’s big guns in Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder started positively with Ibaka shaking his opening night rust off by splashing a jumper. Early on, the Magic showed their intentions by grinding out a quick lead. The Thunder bigs were aggressive on the glass and distributed well, and KD racked up a quick 8 points. The defense was another story, however, and for the next three quarters the Magic’s bigs of Nikola Vucevic and Tobias Harris hounded the interior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orlando continued to build their lead in the second quarter while the Thunder struggled to get open looks to go down. It seemed to be one of those nights where shots weren’t going to fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vucevic was on fire. Sloppy offensive play and lacadasical interior defense saw the Magic jump out to a double digit lead.  Fumbled passes. More wide open looks missed. As the Magic’s lead jumped up to 15, one of the only positives was the bigs’ hard work giving second chances on the offensive end. Another was Westbrook aggressibely attacking the rim and baiting the opposing guards into foul trouble. Unfortunately, shots he usually makes weren’t falling, and to add to the struggles, the half ended with Waiters bouncing a wide open corner three off the side of the backboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder came out swinging in the third quarter looking to right the ship, but once again the Magic fired back. Second chance putbacks from the Magic became a regular occurrence. The team veteran, Evan Fournier, capped off a Thunder momentum killer with a 3-pointer to go up 16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then the Thunder reminded me what they do so frequently. They out athlete you. For the second time in two games, new coach Billy Donovan got another test on his tactical lineup management and adjustments his former counterpart was constantly questioned on. And he passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder had a big task to climb out of the 18 point deficient they found themselves in starting the fourth quarter. I had to ask myself “Did Kanter even play in the first half?” It may sounds strange, but I can understand Donavon watching his team get torched on the interior causing hesitation letting Kanter play big minutes. As the 4th quarter progressed, however, there didn’t appear to be any hesitation as Kanter’s stat line continued to grow. He was laying in easy an contested baskets, and challenged every rebound. He looked fantastic, and after the Thunder whittled the opponents lead to 10, Westbrook came up with a big steal and emphatic dunk to cut it to single digits. However, the Magic continued to answer everything the Thunder threw, especially by keeping plays alive with offensive rebounds. They even forced valuable time to burn off the clock by snagging a rebound on their own free throw miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down the stretch, the Donavon threw out an “unconventional” lineup. Durant and Westbrook spearheaded Augustine, Kanter, and Waiters to continue to fight. And fight. One thing became very clear: Westbrook wanted to win this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So he took it over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were several minutes left in the fourth (and two periods of overtime left), but Westbrook was not about to let the Thunder lose this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Durant nailed a cold blooded 3 to take the lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magic guard Victor Oladipo then appeared to seal the deal with his response to go back up 3 with seconds left and no timeout remaining for the Thunder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russell. Freaking. Westbrook. From five feet over half court he banked it in with less than a second on the clock. Overtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder go up to start overtime for the first time since their basket off the opening tip. The Thunder went back to small ball, with Adams replacing Kanter. They started strong, but soon tapered off, allowing the Magic back within reach. Roberson played spectacular defense, but Oladipo did it again, hitting an amazing shot. 2nd Overtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Durant was visibly tired by this point, ending the game with 53 minutes played, but he never gave up. Westbrook and Durant are too much to handle when they’re fully engaged, and this rang true for the youngsters of the Orlando Magic. They stayed close however, and Steven Adams was forced to hit two clutch free throws to go up four points and keep it out of reach. As the free throw game continued, however, Westbrook missed one and it was up to the Thunder’s defense to end the game. Durant came through big, blocking two consecutive 3-point attempts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder win. Breathe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was an unexpectedly uphill, difficult battle to fight, but the Thunder are 2-0 and already showing signs of how much they want this. They know very well what one game cost them last year. Credit to Russ for inspiring that fight and taking the game over. 48 points, and just 2 rebounds shy of a triple-double. Credit to KD for being the silky, smooth self he always has been, racking up 43 points of his own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there were obviously flaws in the game (little to no transition offense through 3 quarters, the berating by the Magic bigs in the interior, wide open 3-point looks for Oladipo and Elfrid Payton, and a porous defensive effort for three and a half quarters) there were positive takeaways. Donavon threw lineups out on the court to give the Thunder a chance, the end of the game play to spring KD up for a 3 ball to tie the game was executed beautifully, and the fight this team showed to tell the league theyre still the Thunder and they mean business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a couple of quick shoutouts. Gotta give it to Brian Davis. I hate blatant homer-ism, but it’s been a long offseason and it was great to hear him again. Also, Elfin Payton’s basketball skills are almost as awesome as his hair. I look forward to watching his future highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up:  Nuggets @ Thunder, Sunday, Nov 1.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Eyeball Test: Spurs @ Thunder</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;sas-106---okc-112&quot;&gt;SAS 106 - OKC 112&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here. We. Go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roberson started the game right from the tip with a great scoring hustle play. Otherwise he was an offensive potato, allowing the Spurs to switch their smaller guards (Tony Parker and Patty Mills) off of Westbrook. It added to the early struggles, and it showed why Roberson can be a detriment to the offense beyond allowing his man to help off and block passing lanes. It leaves Westbrook working against a bigger, better defender.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Thunder could not stop the Spurs to start. Yes, Kawhi Leonard had a career night, but the Thunder trailed the Spurs until late because the defense struggled to stop anything until they settled down and focused in the 4th quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A big part of the defensive switch was Collison. He has a way of reminding the team what tenacity they need to bring, and it changed the game after his minutes in the second half.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kanter didn’t stick out on defense. He wasn’t good and there were times when a Spur would drive right by him for an uncontested look, but he did look like he was legitimately trying. The problem? He’s just so slow. He has the footwork to devastate on post-ups and the positioning to dominate the boards, but he struggles to move anywhere quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of Kanter, he knows how to rip down a rebound and put it back up quickly. He’s a beast under the basket.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Westbrook sure was taking a lot of threes to start the game, but once he made one it tapered off. He ended the game 3-6 from distance, even nailing a critical one late in the game, catching it in the corner with under 3 seconds left on the clock.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. The Thunder started the game appearing to try really hard to put the new offense into play. If, however, the Spurs defense kept them from converting on their first two passes, or the shot clock got to 16 seconds, they seemed to get bogged down. This resulted in a lot of deflected or stolen passes. Kawhi Leonard was everywhere, and the Spurs seemed to be in every single one of the Thunder’s passing lanes for the majority of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff Van Gundy made a good point: Starting your season off against a disciplined and very talented Spurs team is the perfect litmus test. The Thunder, and especially Coach Billy Donovan’s staff, will more easily be able to see what isn’t working and what to work on. Getting a win through late-game execution is big bonus points.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the first quarter, when Westbrook or Durant got sick of turning it over they went back to their isolation bread-and-butter. Westbrook post-ups may be a part of the Thunder’s offense (because he’s bigger and stronger) but Durant seemed to be pushing. As the game went on he looked better and better, going from being hounded into turnovers and blocked shots by Kawhi to catching the ball off pin downs in the flow of the offense. He still doesn’t handle pesky defenders in his face, but as the game went on he seemed to work his way out of those iso struggles, using movement within the offense to aid him. A good sign.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Slim Reaper made an appearance. As a refresher, Slim Reaper occurrences take place when Durant unconsciously drops a dagger 3-pointer from straight away. It happened during the Thunder’s run late in the fourth quarter, and it was beautiful to see.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also relating to confidence: Serge Ibaka struggled early. He was hesitating on everything. Maybe it was because nothing was falling for him, but as soon as he was decisive with his actions the smooth mid-range jumpers we’re used to seeing began to fall.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russell Westbrook is so fast.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This team is still so exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Billy Donovan fluidly, and constantly, substituted his players throughout the night. When Ibaka was struggling he sat for the next minute as Kanter got a look, before hitting the floor again. I can’t quite tell if Donovan is still working through his players to see what works, or if he was simply countering what Popovich was throwing out. There’s a starting and a closing lineup, but in between it’s anyone’s guess as to who we’ll see together on a given night. I don’t even think Donovan knows, which is a flexibility we’re not used to seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was weird, though, not seeing Scott Brooks storm off the bench to the middle of the court after a frustration timeout.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ‘Bruise Bros’ combo of Adams and Kanter saw the floor together on two separate occasions. Westbrook also took the floor with the bench several times. Donovan didn’t seem to happy that he played Westbrook as much as he did, so it’ll be interesting to see how much this happens going forward. It did, however, resume last year’s effective Westbrook-Kanter connection, allowing for offensive firepower while Durant rests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Westbrook-to-Adams also continued over from the preseason, with Adams catching Westbrook’s passes for clean finishes on back to back possessions. If it’s working, why not keep trying it?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;D.J. Augustin knows what he’s doing and he keeps reminding me. As time goes on I feel the likelihood of Cameron Payne breaking into the rotation dropping significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No Singler tonight. Or Mcgary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dion Waiters looked good. He passed up a shot to hit an open Morrow at one point, and continued to appear comfortable working within the offense. He’s also finishing games it appears. So what happens when the clock winds down in crunch-time and Waiters has the ball? Step back fadeaway! Twice. They were needed, and they went in. What if they didn’t though? Post game Coach Donovan acted like this was part of the gameplan, however, and Waiters didn’t seem about to argue it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What on this green Earth was Danny Green doing on that final attempt for the Spurs to tie or take the lead? I somehow can’t see that as the out-of-bounds play that was drawn up by Popovich.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;eyeball-test&quot;&gt;Eyeball Test?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Promising Work In Progress.&lt;/strong&gt; It was a season opener against a very good team that never loses it’s first game, so it was going to be a true test. With a sloppy start the Thunder were shown their weaknesses, but through a dynamic Russell Westbrook and solid bench play they managed to bring it all together to round into form the last 5 minutes and pull out a win.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Game Recap: Spurs vs. Thunder</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;sas-106---okc-112&quot;&gt;SAS 106 - OKC 112&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a game mostly controlled by the San Antonio Spurs, the Thunder was able to come out on top in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most matchups between these two teams, the game stayed pretty close throughout, though it seemed as though the Spurs were in control for the majority of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder got off to a rough start offensively, while the Spurs settled into an early rhythm. The Thunder was getting a lot of open looks, but early on they were not falling. However, thanks to Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant, who combined for 18 first quarter points, the Thunder lead 29-27 at the end of the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second quarter was the Thunder’s worst quarter, and it was during this quarter that the Spurs really seemed in control. They did this with great defense, forcing 11 turnovers and only sending the Thunder to the free throw line for three attempts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the Thunder struggled in the second quarter, there were some bright spots in D.J. Augustin, Dion Waiters and Enes Kanter, who all played well in their first half minutes. Augustin and Waiters were both making smart decisions and Kanter was a beast on the glass as usual, tallying six points and eight rebounds in the first half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the Spurs defense was solid in the first half, the Thunder still shot 50 percent, though they were just 3-11 from beyond the arc. After one half the Thunder were down 55-50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third quarter featured both teams trading runs for the bulk of the quarter, with Westbrook carrying the Thunder, while Durant’s offense sputtered due to some tough defense from Kawhi Leonard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kanter continued his success in the third, reaching the double-double plateau after playing just 17 minutes. Ibaka, who struggled in the first half, found some rhythm in the third quarter as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder would eventually win the third quarter by a point, making the score 83-79 in favor of the Spurs after three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spurs controlled the fourth quarter for a while, but the Thunder was able to hang around due to some timely buckets by Westbrook, Kanter, Anthony Morrow and Steven Adams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around the four-minute mark the Thunder seemed to be taking control of the game, and though it would remain close until the end, the Thunder would not be held back. Waiters hit two big jumpers late, and Westbrook added a huge clutch three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after a Leonard and-1 the Spurs were down by just two. They got the ball back with about 20 second remaining, but Danny Green launched an ill-advised prayer, giving the Thunder the chance to put the game away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder would hit the late game free throws to finish the game off, and won with a final score of 112-106.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Durant scored 22 but struggled most of the game, and was noticeably outmatched by Leonard. He got a lot of good looks but never found a consistent stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Westbrook finished with 33 points and 10 assists and Kanter finished with an impressive double-double of 15 points and 16 rebounds. The rest of the scoring was refreshingly balanced, with four more guys with eight points or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder will hope to carry some momentum from this big win into its Friday night matchup with the Orlando Magic.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kevin Durant Season Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Kevin Durant, who is coming off a disappointing and injury riddled season, will look to return to his MVP form during the 2015-16 season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Durant played in just 27 games last season, and though he averaged solid numbers with 25.4 points, 6.6 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game, he was unable to help the Thunder reach the playoffs due to his lingering foot injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year Durant appears to be healthy and ready to help the Thunder compete for a championship again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some things to look for in Durant’s ninth NBA season:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;health&quot;&gt;Health&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-28/durant1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt; Kevin Jairaj – USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is clearly the biggest concern for Kevin Durant this season. Before last season’s 27 games, he had never played less than 66 games in a season. Historically he has been healthy, and Thunder fans and NBA fans in general have to hope that last year was a fluke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Durant played well in the preseason, and he looked as though he hasn’t lost a step. All signs point to him being healthy now, and it seems as though his most recent operation was a lot more successful than the first two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Durant can stay healthy, the Thunder should be one of the best teams in the NBA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;leadership&quot;&gt;Leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-28/durant2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt; Mark D. Smith – USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Durant is just 27 years old, but behind Nick Collison and Steve Novak, he is the third most experienced player on this Thunder roster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Durant’s experience consists of six all-star appearances, 73 playoff games and one well-deserved MVP trophy. Needless to say, he has to be a leader on this team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder has a lot of young players, including Steven Adams, Andre Roberson, Dion Waiters, Cameron Payne and Mitch McGary, who could all be important parts of a Thunder championship run. These guys will need a lot of guidance, and Durant is one of the best guys to provide it. He’s really developed his game over the years to make himself more than one of the league’s top scorers, and his expertise can certainly be used to mold some of his young teammates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look for Durant to have a strong leadership role on this young but talented Thunder roster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dominance&quot;&gt;Dominance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-28/durant3.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt; Soobum Im – USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Durant’s last full season was his incredible 2013-14 MVP campaign, and Thunder fans should be optimistic that a healthy Durant can return to that season’s level of dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Durant is at his best, there’s only one player that can give him a run for the title of best player in the world, and the gap between him and LeBron James was certainly closing before last year’s injury. This year Durant will look to pick up where he left off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his 27 games last year, Durant put up good numbers and shot 51 percent from the field, 40 percent from beyond the arc and 85 percent from the free throw line. Though his season was short, these numbers put up with lingering injury problems give just a small taste of Durant’s potential. He’s capable of greatness, and the only thing that can hold him back at this point is injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A healthy Durant is the second best player in the world, and at times a case could be made calling him the best. This year he will look to return to his dominant MVP form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-28/durant4.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt; Steve Mitchell – USA TODAY Sports &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Durant’s season last year was cut way short, and it was a shame to watch as the Thunder was unable to reach the playoffs without him. This season should end with a very different outcome, as Durant should help the Thunder contend for an NBA championship.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Harden Trade Review: Rebuttal</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Berry Tramel of the Oklahoman just wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;http://newsok.com/harden-trade-becomes-less-tolerable-with-each-passing-year/article/5456260&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; claiming the trade that sent James Harden to Houston exactly three years ago has become “less tolerable” as the years have passed. He poses that due to the lack of championship rings in OKC, Sam Presti failed. That keeping Harden for his contract season, without an details on what could have happened had he left town on another team’s max offer sheet, would have been superior to three seasons of injuries leading to two playoff series losses and whatever you want to call last year. It now lies in “what-might-have-been land”. So let us go there for arguments sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-we-value-a-trade&quot;&gt;How do we value a trade?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, however, what goes into valuing a trade? Circumstance changes everything, and the championship aspirations of the OKC Thunder can’t be ignored. Yes, Harden is probably the best shooting guard in the NBA today. Yes, star power decides championships. Had Harden been a malcontent, unhappy with his role, Sam Presti could have sent him to Houston, and the narrative would have been filled with ‘locker room cancer’ talk. This was never even close to the case, but James Harden did believe in his abilities and was never going to become the James Harden we see today had he remained in OKC. As his mother put it &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/13869848/rockets-guard-james-harden-found-place-excel-show-strengths-houston&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“He would never get the ball playing with Kevin and Russell… Now he’s in Houston. And he’s shining.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the trade initially happened the Thunder obtained players, namely Kevin Martin, and three draft picks. They set themselves up financially for the future to re-sign Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, remain under the cap to go after potential free agent role players, and those draft picks had deadly potential in the hands of Sam Presti and his staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Thunder extended Ibaka and Harden continually said that he wasn’t involved with his contract negotiations, leaving them up to his agent, it was the first signs that Presti could potentially pull the trigger. He did. The Thunder have since had two key injuries during playoff series that have resulted in the only playoff series losses since they reached the Finals with Harden. One of Tramel’s two main points is that Harden would have been able to stem the tide of Westbrook going down at the hands of Patrick Beverly. That would have left the bench depleted, and the Thunder needed all three of their stars as was demonstrated when Harden disappeared in the 2012 Finals. So we can’t value a trade by what might have happened. We have to look at what it gave versus what it would have given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;harden--adams-mcgary-abrines-and-more&quot;&gt;Harden = Adams, McGary, Abrines, and more…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Martin left town a year later, Jeremy Lamb never panned out and is now looking to make a name in Charlotte. Those three draft picks turned into Steven Adams, Mitch McGary, and Alex Abrines. They are what we have to dissect the trade. We have to ignore Martin’s departure and the absurd cap rise. We have to be fair to the moment and what assets are currently making an impact for OKC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harden would have never been the Harden we know today. If he was, his openly clear aspirations to win MVP could very well be tearing a rift in a locker room of a team trying to mesh under a new system. Harden wasn’t in OKC to surpass Westbrook or Durant. He was the sixth man meant to rip apart opposing benches. It was a clear strength for a team that struggled with overall depth, especially in the front court. OKC brought in the ghost of Kendrick Perkins as an improvement to its inside defensive presence, and in the years since has routinely switched out its backup center. When Eric Maynor tore his ACL he was never the same. Reggie Jackson was Maynor’s replacement, but he was more in the mold of a Westbrook or Harden than a Maynor. He could drive and finish, and has shown the ability to take over games for short stretches. He needed the ball in his hands to be effective, and with Harden in town this would have never happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harden runs the Houston offense through himself much as he ran the Thunder’s second unit. Reggie Jackson filled that role. He didn’t replace Harden, but he filled his role. He wouldn’t have become the player he is today with Harden still in OKC. With those opportunities, no matter what you think of Reggie Jackson’s abilities, he was able to command a major contract as well as send significant trade pieces to the Thunder. Those pieces included Enes Kanter and D.J. Augustin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also included in the Reggie Jackson trade was Kendrick Perkins. He and Nick Collison were the only consistent big man for the Thunder until Steven Adams was drafted with one of the draft picks from the Harden trade. Adams learned quickly from Perkins on the defensive end, and his added athleticism has allowed him to become the starting center of the Thunder. He is a solid defender, is improving his catch for pick and role finishes, and has a decent hook shot. His development is one of the primary reasons the Thunder were comfortable sending Perkins away for Kanter. Without Adams and cap flexibility the Thunder may have been forced to keep what remained of Perk out of sheer necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder also felt comfortable keeping Kanter, because even with his contract they will be able to sign Durant in free agency while avoiding the repeater tax. Having Harden’s contract on the roster, even as the cap inflates next year, hurts the limited flexibility the team has. The past few seasons free agent signings have been rare, but acquisitions like Anthony Morrow wouldn’t have been possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This team’s depth has been growing steadily due to the repercussions of losing Harden. McGary is a future impact player with a very nice offensive skill set already. Alex Abrines can hit shots from deep and is still gaining experience playing in Europe. Those are two of the three draft picks the Thunder received for Harden, and they are either on the fringe of the rotation or half the world away because of how deep this team is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair to Berry Tramel, the fact that all the trade pieces haven’t had time to show their full return yet was acknowledged in his article, albeit in passing. He didn’t, however, take into account that major superstar injuries end playoff runs no matter who you are, and because the Thunder traded James Harden they have been able to put together their deepest team yet. They have the flexibility to re-sign their three stars and the depth to push for not just one, but multiple championships in the immediate future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future is bright. The Houston Rockets gained a superstar, but the Thunder have the better team. And it’s sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t gauge the value of a trade simply because a team has had crippling injuries and hasn’t won a championship. There are no guarantees in this league.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kyle Singler Season Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-26/singler1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Rick Scuteri - USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyle Singler was scouted by Sam Presti during his time at Duke. He’s the role player with length that Presti likes, and so he was brought over in the trade deadline unloading of Reggie Jackson last season. When he reached OKC he was asked to slip into the starting small forward spot during a dumpster fire season plagued by unrelenting injuries. Things didn’t go so well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things we’re looking for Kyle Singler to improve on this season:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shooting&quot;&gt;Shooting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before reaching OKC, Singler was shooting 40 percent from the field, with nearly identical percentages from both 3- and 2-point range. It was the result of a steady climb in field goal percentage his first four seasons. Then he was traded and the floor fell out. Technically his 3-point shooting only took a 3 percent hit, but from inside the arc his shooting dropped to 28 percent. In 456 minutes, with 18 games starting, he only made 32 field goals on a team struggling dearly for offense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pressure of having to replace Kevin Durant would be daunting for anyone, which is understandable, and learning a new system mid-season can be tricky. It’s still a fascinating drop in production, however, and one neither Singler nor the Thunder can afford this season. In the preseason his field goal percentage has risen back to above 40 percent, but that’s preseason and he’ll need to get even better than that to help out his team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defense&quot;&gt;Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singler hasn’t looked comfortable. Maybe that’s just how he appears, but if there’s one area he can’t afford to be lost on, it’s defense. He was brought in to replace Roberson one game in the preseason after Roberson picked up two quick fouls. In the ideal scenario Singler can come in and show some semblance of the same defensive tenacity, while also aiding in offensive spacing. Until Huestis is ready (if that ever happens), Singler is really the only wing defender with the size and mobility to take Roberson’s place without relying on Durant to buckle down defensively while also doing what he needs to on offense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory he’s a great piece for the Thunder, but until he shows differently the memory of last season’s unecessary and constant fouling remains scary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hair-quotes-and-stability&quot;&gt;Hair, Quotes, and Stability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this offseason Singler time travelled to the early 2000’s and brought back his new hair style. He then supplied some &lt;em&gt;strange&lt;/em&gt; quotes during media day. When asked why Sam Presti had been raving about him, he replied “I haven’t been to any raves with [Presti].” It’s an odd thing thing to say, but we’ll let it all slide. Why? Because we need stability from Singler more than we need him to make any sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a big year for the franchise. There are quite a few question marks on this team, but Singler is one piece who’s intended purpose is that of the glue. He seems to know and like his role, so let’s just hope he follows through on that with a return to form that is stable and accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Nick Collison Season Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-26/collison1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Nick Collison - Instagram&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Collison is entering his 12th season in the NBA. He has spent his entire career with the same franchise and has seen the franchise go through a change in location, mascot, and color scheme. Collison has always been a fan favorite in Oklahoma City due to his hard hat, blue collar working attitude and willingness to make the hustle plays. Collison’s focus for the last several years has been defense and rebounding. It will be interesting to see what role he plays this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things to look for from Nick Collison this season:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hustle&quot;&gt;Hustle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-26/collison2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Bryan Terry - The Oklahoman&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Collison might be the definition of a hustle player. Collison has never cracked double-digit averages in scoring during his long career. You do not stick around the league without scoring unless you are able to do a lot of other things well. Nick Collison is that player. He rebounds the ball well and will always take the extra dive to save a loose ball from going out of bounds. Nobody will soon forget the post season when it seemed like Collison was constantly bleeding from his face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defense&quot;&gt;Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-26/collison3.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Andy Lyons – Getty Images North America&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collison has never been a scoring machine in the NBA. The most points he averaged in a season was in the 2007-2008 NBA season – the last season in Seattle, for that matter. Last season he averaged only 4.1 ppg and shot just 41.9% from the field. These are both new lows, with his shooting performance being by far the worst of his career. But the good news is that the Thunder do not rely on Collison for his offense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with countless other things that he does for the Thunder organization, Collison brings tenacious defense to the team. He has served as the resident defender when playing guys from Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol to guys like Thiago Splitter and Chris Andersen. He knows how to get under guys’ skin. It seems he passed that ability down to Steven Adams as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mentorship&quot;&gt;Mentorship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-26/collison4.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Steven Adams - Twitter (@RealStevenAdams)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Derek Fisher settled into the head coaching role in New York City, Collison is now the resident veteran on the Thunder. The team is not a bunch of kids like it was in 2012. Guys like Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant are now seasoned players and you have to think that being around Collison helped them grow as professionals as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player most like Collison on today’s roster is Mitch McGary in terms of outlook and ability and things that both players do well. However, Collison and Steven Adams have a buddy bromance that is the most fun non-basketball thing to follow for this team. Collison has taught Adams the ability to anger other big men without getting in trouble himself. Collison’s fingerprints are on the team. On a personal note – I cannot wait to hopefully one day see him healthy on the Thunder bench yet wearing a suit as a coach.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thunder Weekly Forecast</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;games&quot;&gt;Games&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wednesday-october-28-at-700-pm-cst--vs-san-antonio-spurs&quot;&gt;Wednesday, October 28 at 7:00 PM CST – vs. San Antonio Spurs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder will start the season with a tough home game against the ever-dangerous Spurs. There are plenty of storylines to watch in this game: Kevin Durant’s return, LaMarcus Aldridge’s Spurs debut, and legendary coach Gregg Popovich vs. rookie Billy Donovan. The Thunder would love to start the season with a big victory, and this game should prove to be a great one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;friday-october-30-at-600-pm-cst--at-orlando-magic&quot;&gt;Friday, October 30 at 6:00 PM CST – at Orlando Magic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game two comes on the road against the Magic, a young team with a lot of talent in guys like Victor Oladipo and Nikola Vucevic. This Magic team is no slouch, but the Thunder should be able to overpower them and take a victory on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sunday-november-1-at-600-pm-cst--vs-denver-nuggets&quot;&gt;Sunday, November 1 at 6:00 PM CST – vs. Denver Nuggets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder’s final game of the week falls on Sunday, against Denver. The Nuggets are not likely to be very good this year, and new head coach Mike Malone certainly has his work cut out for him. This game should be a pretty easy victory for the Thunder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;three-things-to-watch-for&quot;&gt;Three Things to Watch for:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-return-of-kevin-durant&quot;&gt;The Return of Kevin Durant:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who hasn’t been looking forward to this since April? Durant is coming off a season ruined by his foot injury, and will look to bounce back to his 2013-14 MVP form. Everyone is nervous that his foot problems will linger, but fans have a reason to be optimistic after watching him play like the Durant we know and love in the preseason. So long as he is healthy, Durant should have no problems returning to dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;billy-donovan&quot;&gt;Billy Donovan:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Thunder’s new coach will begin the season with high expectations. Scott Brooks was fired at the end of last season, following the Thunder’s first time missing the playoffs since the 2008-09 season. Brooks was unable to get the Thunder over the hump and win a championship, and the Thunder decided to gamble on a rookie coach in Donovan. He had plenty of success coaching at the University of Florida, and is highly regarded, so the hope is certainly that he can take the Thunder to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;offense-vs-defense&quot;&gt;Offense vs. Defense:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems to be no question that the Thunder offense should be deadly, with the likes of Durant, Russell Westbrook, Enes Kanter, Serge Ibaka, Dion Waiters and Anthony Morrow all available as scoring options. The questions, however, lie on defense. The Thunder have some great defensive players like Ibaka, Steven Adams and Andre Roberson, but on the other hand they have guys like Kanter and Morrow, who struggle on the defensive end. The first unit defense should be good, but a second unit that features both Kanter and Morrow may struggle on that front. It’s certainly something to look out for as the Thunder opens the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;around-the-league&quot;&gt;Around the League:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some games around the NBA to watch for this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cleveland-cavaliers-at-chicago-bulls--tuesday-october-27-at-700-pm-cst&quot;&gt;Cleveland Cavaliers at Chicago Bulls – Tuesday, October 27 at 7:00 PM CST&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of two games that will kick off the two 2014-15 season, and is quite possibly an Easter Conference Finals matchup preview. It’s certainly early to call something like that, but both of these teams should be very good this year, and this game will be a good one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dallas-mavericks-at-los-angeles-clippers--thursday-october-29-at-930-pm-cst&quot;&gt;Dallas Mavericks at Los Angeles Clippers – Thursday, October 29 at 9:30 PM CST&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who doesn’t love some NBA drama? Clippers center DeAndre Jordan bailed on his Dallas contract this offseason, and luckily for NBA fans, they are set to meet in week one. The Clippers are no doubt better than Dallas, and should win, but the drama behind this matchup should make it entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;golden-state-warriors-at-houston-rockets--friday-october-30-at-830-pm-cst&quot;&gt;Golden State Warriors at Houston Rockets – Friday, October 30 at 8:30 PM CST&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reigning champs with their MVP Steph Curry will take on MVP runner up James Harden’s Rockets. Both of these teams are title contenders this year, and this game should be fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;by-the-numbers&quot;&gt;By the Numbers:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section&quot;&gt;10.2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amount of rebounds Ibaka has averaged against the Spurs in his career. It’s the only team he’s averaged double-digit boards against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-1&quot;&gt;502&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amount of college wins for Coach Donovan. He’ll hope to continue his success in the NBA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-2&quot;&gt;18.1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dion Waiters’ career points per game against Orlando, the most he’s averaged against any team. He’s also shot 47 percent against the Magic.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Serge Ibaka Season Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Serge Ibaka, who’s coming off yet another solid season in an Oklahoma City Thunder uniform, will look to continue his success in his seventh NBA season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Ibaka missed time due to injuries in the 2014-15 season, he still put up solid numbers, averaging 14.3 points, 7.8 rebounds and 2.4 blocks per game. His overall field goal percentage went down, but this was due to his increased three point shooting. He made about 38 percent of his threes though, which is very good, especially for a rim protecting power forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some things we’re looking for in Serge’s 2015-16 season:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;health&quot;&gt;Health&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-25/Ibaka 1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Mark D. Smith – USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ibaka has dealt with injuries for two straight seasons, with his 2013-14 injury coming at a crucial point in the playoffs. It’s no secret that the Thunder was a constant victim of the injury bug last season, and the hope this year is that this will not be the case, especially for players like Ibaka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ibaka plays a crucial role on this team, providing great input on offense, defense and rebounding. The first two games of the 2013-14 Spurs series shows that the Thunder aren’t likely to succeed without a healthy Ibaka, so hopefully he is able to complete this season without any issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ibaka did not play in FIBA EuroBasket 2015 this summer, so he should be well rested and ready to contribute to a new and improved Thunder squad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defense&quot;&gt;Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-25/Ibaka 2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Robert Hanashiro – USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense has always been one of Ibaka’s strengths. He started as an incredible help defender and rim protector, and over the years has expanded to be a pretty solid on the ball defender as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing is different this year: Ibaka has never played significant time next to another big like Enes Kanter, who struggles so much on the defensive end. This may see Ibaka’s defensive responsibilities increase, as the Thunder coaching staff is likely hoping that he can help pick up some of Kanter’s slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody should be worried about Ibaka’s defensive abilities, as he’s proven himself time and again on that end of the court, but his defensive workload might be something to look out for this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scoring&quot;&gt;Scoring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-25/Ibaka 3.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Anthony Gruppuso – USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder has never had so many offensive weapons at once, with a squad consisting of Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Dion Waiters, Anthony Morrow, Kanter and Ibaka. That doesn’t even include guys like D.J. Augustin and Mitch McGary, who certainly have some offensive abilities as well. What this should mean for Ibaka is plenty of open looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect a lot of Ibaka’s scoring to come from his midrange game, which is undoubtedly one of the best in the league, and expect him to shoot quite a few threes again too. Ibaka’s expanded range has made him even more valuable on offense, and It should be easy for him to put up some points this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With only so many shots to go around, Ibaka may not up his overall scoring numbers, but he should have plenty of chances to score with ease, and he should be an important part of the Thunder’s new offensive onslaught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/2015-10-25/Ibaka 4.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Rick Scuteri – USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thunder is a much better team with a healthy Ibaka, and that’s what they hope to get this season. Ibaka should be an important part of the team yet again, and should post another successful season in Thunder blue.&lt;/p&gt;
