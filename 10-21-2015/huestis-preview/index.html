<p class="tagline">Oklahoma City Blue</p>

<p>Huestis was a first round draft pick (29th Overall) in the 2014 NBA draft. Instead of immediately signing with the Thunder he instead played for a year in the NBA D-League with the Oklahoma City affiliate – The Blue. If he accomplishes nothing else in his time in the NBA he will be a historical tidbit known as the first ever “domestic draft-and-stash.” In his one season in the D-League Huestis had a solid season. Huestis played in 44 games, starting in 43, and averaged 10.3 PPG, 4.6 RPG, 1.1 APG, and 1.6 BPG in just over 33 minutes per game. Huestis also finished his college career as the leading shot blocker in Stanford basketball history. A lot has been made of his intelligence, but we have yet to see how it converts to court production.</p>

<p>Here are a few things to watch over the course of the season:</p>

<h3 id="number-of-games">Number of Games</h3>

<p>I expect that Huestis will move fluidly back and forth across Reno Avenue. He will continue to see his fair share of D-League games, while also making an attempt to crack an absolutely stacked OKC roster. Huestis and his management view him as a small forward rather than a power forward or stretch 4 like he played at Stanford. Turns out being a small forward on the same team as Kevin Durant makes finding minutes difficult. The most accurate comparison for Huestis in terms of games played might be Jeremy Lamb and Perry Jones. Early in their stints in OKC they moved up and down between the NBA and D-League. Huestis will do the same this season.</p>

<h3 id="role">Role</h3>

<p>Project. Huestis has talent. Anyone who has watched the Thunder over their OKC tenure knows that they will attempt to make the most out of any first round draft pick. Huestis will get his opportunity to stay with the organization, but finding actual minutes will be difficult. He will be an energy guy that can play multiple positions during walk-throughs and practices. He provides great length and will do whatever is asked of him, which in itself can disrupt opponents. His year in the D-League may have been his best shot to prove himself in the NBA, considering how thin the OKC bench got during last seasons injury plague. There’s a very good chance he only sees the floor of Chesapeake Energy Arena during massive blowout games.</p>

<h3 id="domestic-draft-and-stash-effects">Domestic Draft and Stash Effects</h3>

<p>The Thunder drafted Huestis out of Stanford in the first round of the 2014 NBA Draft. First round draft picks historically receive guaranteed contracts. Huestis, however, did not sign the contract. Instead he spent one year in the D-League, which allowed Oklahoma City to avoid a luxury tax situation and also allowed one more open roster spot. Huestis did this on the promise of Oklahoma City signing him to his deal after one year. This summer, Oklahoma City made good on the arrangement and signed Huestis to a 4-year rookie-scale deal. This deal actually ended up being worth more money than if he had signed immediately after the draft. In terms of Oklahoma City’s tax situation, the domestic draft-and-stash worked great. Huestis was not on the roster and so his salary did not count against the cap limit. The Thunder are in a predicament this season however, as signing Huestis pushed the Thunder to the NBA maximum 15 players on the roster. Typically Sam Presti has preferred to keep an open roster spot for flexibility, but that is not the case this season so far.</p>

<p>Here’s to a successful rookie season, Mr. Huestis!</p>
