<p>Well that just happened. I’m glad I was taking notes throughout the game, because I would have forgotten everything that happened before 30 seconds left in regulation after one of the most absurd 2OT finishes ever.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If Roberson can’t shoot he at least has to be able to be active and pass the ball well. He threw it out of bounds enough times early to bring in Morrow to replace him.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of guards that can’t handle Westbrook’s size try to get under his skin (see: Patrick Beverly). Elfrid Payton was attempting just that last night, and it didn’t go so well for him. If anyone has the ability to hand out cheap fouls to his opponents it’s Westbrook, and he put Payton in foul trouble consistently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That pick and roll with Adams is so promising. You can tell he’s worked on rolling hard to the basket and getting ready for either Westbrook or Durant to hit him for a big finish at the rim.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very slow start. It’s the beginning of the season and it’s the Magic, but that was just bad. Donovan called a timeout and it appeared to be effective, giving the Thunder a burst. Sadly that burst didn’t last very long.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Augustin’s style of play is so important for this team. With the offensive weapons of Waiters and Kanter coming off the bench with him, the ability to collectively control the game and be a solid playmaker is so necessary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Donovan was looking for space, going small with Durant at the 4 and Kanter at the 5. The problem was there was absolutely no rim protection and the Magic kept hammering it into the paint. Even when Ibaka was switched out in place of Kanter the same problems persisted. Small ball defense is definitely a work in progress. (It worked late in the game, but there are still holes.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As sloppy as the the offense seemed it’s surprising how the Thunder were still able to score more than 50 points in the first half. The problem on this team is going to be its defense because even when it’s offense is struggling it’s still somehow effective.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Durant looked so much smoother. Remember this is from earlier in the game. He still seems a bit off on his timing, letting a pass fly right through his hands, but he’s rounding back into form quickly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That in mind, 53 minutes of playing (as long as it didn’t stress anything physically) looked to help Durant work out a lot of kinks, as he expressed post-game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Billy Donovan had a big motivation test coming out of the halftime break. Result? The defense definitely picked up in effort to start the third. Sadly, once again that didn’t last too long.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Waiter’s two big fadeaways at the end of the Spurs game seemed to boost his confidence in a big way. It showed against the Magic, which isn’t a good thing. Some things are better in moderation. He’s so much more effective when he plays within himself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every fast break that happens reminds me how little we’ve seen so far this season.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dion Waiters with the ball in his hands during crunchtime is so so stressful.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>KD is back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Westbrook is ridiculous. He also <strong>never</strong> gives up. <strong>Never.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it bad that when he hit that nearly half court bank shot I actually thought it looked like a good attempt? Probably, but who cares.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seeing Joey Crawford reminds me that it’s his world and we’re just living in it. Then Westbrook did his thing, so please swap ‘Joey Crawford’ for ‘Russell Westbrook in that last sentence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Monty Williams trying to corral the team back to the bench after Westbrook’s crazy 3-pointer was so amusing. Good luck with that Monty.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only have a few things to note from the two overtimes. 1. Westbrook is unstoppable. 2. Steven Adams had some super feathery clutch free throws. 3. Durant left everything on the floor. He was dead tired, but pulled out some <strong>amazing</strong> blocks to close out the game for an incredibly improbable Thunder win.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="eyeball-test">Eyeball Test?</h4>

<p><strong>Speechless but <em>slightly</em> worried.</strong> Westbrook and Durant showed why they’re maybe the best one-two punch of all time. They were incredible. The rest of the team however didn’t contribute in a way that is sustainable, and that will need to be solved as quickly as possible. The defense was downright terrible, that is, until the Thunder decided they didn’t want to lose. Maybe it’s a motivation thing or as the season ramps up it will fix itself, but it’s been bad for the first half of both games so far.</p>
