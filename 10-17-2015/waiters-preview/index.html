<p class="tagline">Kelley L. Cox- USA TODAY Sports</p>

<p>Dion Waiters is coming off his worst season yet in the NBA, but he’ll look to turn it around in his first full season with the Thunder.</p>

<p>The former fourth overall draft pick, who joined the Thunder last season in a trade with the Cleveland Cavaliers, averaged 12.7 points, 2.9 rebounds and 1.9 assists per game, but shot only 39 percent from the field with the Thunder. He showed some flashes of being a great addition to the Thunder, but has yet to consistently contribute.</p>

<p>Here are some things to look for in Dion’s game this year:</p>

<h3 id="finishing">Finishing</h3>

<p><img src="/content/2015-10-17/Waiters 2.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" /></p>

<p class="tagline">Sue Ogrocki – The Associated Press</p>

<p>Anyone that has watched Waiters play can see that he has a great ability to get to the rim. There’s just one thing missing from this skill: he doesn’t finish well. Waiters shot just 48 percent on lay ups last year, and while that percentage would be fantastic for an overall field goal percentage, it is not very good for such close range shots.</p>

<p>For comparison, Russell Westbrook’s percentage on lay ups was 54, and a few other young shooting guards, Bradley Beal and Klay Thompson, shot 57 and 64 percent, respectively. There’s no question that Westbrook, Beal and Thompson are better players than Waiters overall, but there’s no reason that he shouldn’t be able to shoot a higher percentage on these close range shots.</p>

<p>If Waiters can improve in this area, he will become a lot more dangerous on the offensive side.</p>

<h3 id="free-throws">Free Throws</h3>

<p><img src="/content/2015-10-17/Waiters 3.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" /></p>

<p class="tagline">Mark D. Smith – USA TODAY Sports</p>

<p>Waiters has never been an excellent free throw shooter, averaging just 70 percent from the line in his career, but his 62 percent with the Thunder last season was the worst of his career. A percentage like that is really unacceptable for a shooting guard, and this is an area where Waiters must improve.</p>

<p>He only averaged 2.4 free throw attempts per game with the Thunder, but the low frequency of attempts doesn’t excuse the percentage. Perhaps the strangest thing about his shooting woes from the line with OKC was that he was shooting 78 percent with Cleveland before his trade to the Thunder, which is a much more acceptable number. This shows that he’s capable of improving in this area, so hopefully he worked on this in the offseason.</p>

<p>Those who have watched the preseason games can see that he is starting to shoot his free throws lined up to the right of the basket, which is abnormal, but it shows that he’s making an effort to improve. He’s shot just 66 percent from the line so far in the preseason, but given his interest in improving and his higher career percentage, Thunder fans can be optimistic that he will improve his free throw shooting.</p>

<h3 id="passing">Passing</h3>

<p><img src="/content/2015-10-17/Waiters 4.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" /></p>

<p class="tagline">Derick E. Hingle – USA TODAY Sports</p>

<p>Waiters has never averaged more than three assists per game, and he averaged just 1.9 with the Thunder last year. However, watching him play shows that he actually is a very skilled passer, though not always willing. Hopefully he will start to showcase his distributing abilities more this season.</p>

<p>Waiters is likely going to be the Thunder’s sixth man, or may share this role with Enes Kanter, but either way he should have the ball in his hands a lot. For this reason, he should look to feed second unit guys like Kanter, Anthony Morrow and D.J. Augustin. With so many offensive weapons on this year’s Thunder squad, Waiters should easily be able to up his assist numbers, that is if he shows more of a willingness to share the basketball.</p>

<p>The Thunder were near the bottom in team assists per game last year, and this should definitely improve this season. There’s no reason that Waiters can’t be a part of this improvement.</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015-10-17/Waiters 5.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" /></p>

<p class="tagline">Sue Ogrocki – The Associated Press</p>

<p>Though Waiters often struggled last year in OKC, Thunder fans should look forward to some potential improvements. He seems happy as a member of this team, and the team is happy to have him. Here’s hoping that being in a good situation will allow him to improve and exceed expectations.</p>
