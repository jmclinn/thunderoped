    <p class="post-meta">Oct 25, 2015 • Ryan</p>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Serge Ibaka, who’s coming off yet another solid season in an Oklahoma City Thunder uniform, will look to continue his success in his seventh NBA season.</p>

<p>Though Ibaka missed time due to injuries in the 2014-15 season, he still put up solid numbers, averaging 14.3 points, 7.8 rebounds and 2.4 blocks per game. His overall field goal percentage went down, but this was due to his increased three point shooting. He made about 38 percent of his threes though, which is very good, especially for a rim protecting power forward.</p>

<p>Here are some things we’re looking for in Serge’s 2015-16 season:</p>

<h3 id="health">Health</h3>

<p><img src="/content/2015-10-25/Ibaka 1.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" /></p>

<p class="tagline">Mark D. Smith – USA TODAY Sports</p>

<p>Ibaka has dealt with injuries for two straight seasons, with his 2013-14 injury coming at a crucial point in the playoffs. It’s no secret that the Thunder was a constant victim of the injury bug last season, and the hope this year is that this will not be the case, especially for players like Ibaka.</p>

<p>Ibaka plays a crucial role on this team, providing great input on offense, defense and rebounding. The first two games of the 2013-14 Spurs series shows that the Thunder aren’t likely to succeed without a healthy Ibaka, so hopefully he is able to complete this season without any issues.</p>

<p>Ibaka did not play in FIBA EuroBasket 2015 this summer, so he should be well rested and ready to contribute to a new and improved Thunder squad.</p>

<h3 id="defense">Defense</h3>

<p><img src="/content/2015-10-25/Ibaka 2.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" /></p>

<p class="tagline">Robert Hanashiro – USA TODAY Sports</p>

<p>Defense has always been one of Ibaka’s strengths. He started as an incredible help defender and rim protector, and over the years has expanded to be a pretty solid on the ball defender as well.</p>

<p>One thing is different this year: Ibaka has never played significant time next to another big like Enes Kanter, who struggles so much on the defensive end. This may see Ibaka’s defensive responsibilities increase, as the Thunder coaching staff is likely hoping that he can help pick up some of Kanter’s slack.</p>

<p>Nobody should be worried about Ibaka’s defensive abilities, as he’s proven himself time and again on that end of the court, but his defensive workload might be something to look out for this season.</p>

<h3 id="scoring">Scoring</h3>

<p><img src="/content/2015-10-25/Ibaka 3.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" /></p>

<p class="tagline">Anthony Gruppuso – USA TODAY Sports</p>

<p>The Thunder has never had so many offensive weapons at once, with a squad consisting of Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Dion Waiters, Anthony Morrow, Kanter and Ibaka. That doesn’t even include guys like D.J. Augustin and Mitch McGary, who certainly have some offensive abilities as well. What this should mean for Ibaka is plenty of open looks.</p>

<p>Expect a lot of Ibaka’s scoring to come from his midrange game, which is undoubtedly one of the best in the league, and expect him to shoot quite a few threes again too. Ibaka’s expanded range has made him even more valuable on offense, and It should be easy for him to put up some points this season.</p>

<p>With only so many shots to go around, Ibaka may not up his overall scoring numbers, but he should have plenty of chances to score with ease, and he should be an important part of the Thunder’s new offensive onslaught.</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015-10-25/Ibaka 4.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" /></p>

<p class="tagline">Rick Scuteri – USA TODAY Sports</p>

<p>The Thunder is a much better team with a healthy Ibaka, and that’s what they hope to get this season. Ibaka should be an important part of the team yet again, and should post another successful season in Thunder blue.</p>
