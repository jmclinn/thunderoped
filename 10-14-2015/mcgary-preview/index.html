<p>Mitch McGary is entering his sophomore season in the NBA and will look to avoid a sophomore slump. He performed well and quickly became a fan favorite last season. His hustle is inspiring to anybody who has ever wanted to achieve a single thing in their life. The man is nothing short of a spark plug and does a lot of things effectively, and anything he cannot do he will attempt with full vigor.</p>

<p>In limited action last season – he only appeared in 32 games with 2 starts – he averaged 6.3 ppg, 5.2 rpg, and 0.4 apg in just over 15 minutes per game. For playing just a little over one quarter of the game, those are good returns. He makes a great change of pace big that has a different skill set than the rest of our guys. He prefers to play with his face to the basket and has shown flashes of brilliance in his passing game.</p>

<p>Here are some things we would like to see from McGary this season:</p>

<h3 id="hustle">Hustle</h3>

<p><img src="/content/2015-10-14/1.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" /></p>
<p class="tagline">Matt York - Associated Press</p>

<p>McGary will likely not be a permanent fixture in the lineup. He will generally not enter and exit the game at scheduled intervals like we typically saw with Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant under former coach Scottie Brooks. He will be a spell type guy that comes in to give Steven Adams/Serge Ibaka/Enes Kanter a break. If any of the first 3 bigs get in foul trouble then we may see extended minutes from McGary.</p>

<p>McGary brings many of the same attributes to the Thunder as veteran big man Nick Collison. He brings a passing ability not often seen from the block and he plays tenacious defense. The biggest limit on McGary’s playing time may be his propensity for fouling. In his 15 mpg he averaged 2.3 fouls per game. This will work perfectly with what his role for the Thunder should be this year. He will be able to disrupt opposing bigs and will not have to worry about pacing his fouling.</p>

<h3 id="passing">Passing</h3>

<p><img src="/content/2015-10-14/2.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" /></p>
<p class="tagline">Chris Humphreys - USA TODAY Sports</p>

<p>One of McGary’s most talked about attributes coming out of college and transitioning into the pros. He quickly showed off the ability to make creative passes. This will be an important asset in the new offense. This preseason he has played 23 minutes and 17 minutes respectively in the Thunder’s two games this far. He has had 3 assists and 2 assists in those two games. Not great, but also not bad for a big in limited game time. Side note: McGary also hit a three in the second game against Fenerbahçe.</p>

<h3 id="rebounding">Rebounding</h3>

<p><img src="/content/2015-10-14/3.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" /></p>
<p class="tagline">Sue Ogrocki - Associated Press</p>

<p>Rebounding and defense will be the opportunities for McGary to shine most. He averaged a little over 5 per game last season. This is a great return for the limited court time he saw. The man is a beast on the boards. This is the stat where his hustle shows up the most. McGary has proven difficult to stop and keep off the boards. He reached double digit rebounds in 5 games last season including a season (and career) high of 13 against Dallas. He also contributed 12 points on 5/11 shooting that game. Late in February McGary scored 20 points on 10/13 shooting while also pulling down 9 boards. The man knows how to operate around the basket and will continue to be a beast this season on the glass.</p>

<p>Mitch McGary should continue his growth in the NBA this season. Whether or not he sees more minutes this season is yet to be decided. Last season he played significant amounts while Steven Adams and Serge Ibaka missed games due to injury. Either way, he will make the most of any opportunities given. He will be an exciting player to watch all season.</p>
