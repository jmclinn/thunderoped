Enes Kanter is coming off of his best season yet in the NBA, one that was split between the Utah Jazz and the Thunder. Kanter became a member of the Thunder after Sam Presti pulled the trigger on a blockbuster deal that also landed Oklahoma City D.J. Augustin, Kyle Singler and Steve Novak. He jumped right into his new role in OKC, and now is here to stay after signing a monster 4-year contract.

In 26 games with the Thunder, his minutes went up, as did his production. In 31 minutes per game, up four from his time with the Jazz, he averaged 18.7 points on 57 percent shooting and 11 rebounds. Perhaps most impressive was that he averaged five offensive rebounds per game. Looking at numbers like these, there isn’t much room to question Kanter’s worth for the Thunder.

Here are a few things to look for with Kanter this year:

### Post scoring

Kanter brings the Thunder something its never truly had on a consistent basis, and that is low post scoring. Serge Ibaka has never developed much in that area, and having bigs like Steven Adams and Kendrick Perkins has never helped fill that void either. This makes Kanter a crucial part of what should prove to be an explosive Thunder offense.

While we should expect to see some midrange game and perhaps a few three pointers here and there, Kanter should really be earning his money in the paint. Last year he shot 83, 53 and 66 percent on dunks, hook shots and layups respectively. These shots are all products of working hard in the post, and the efficiency he’s shown in that area shows his offensive strengths.

Another great thing about Kanter’s post scoring is that it takes some of the offensive pressure of the Thunder’s big three of Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and Ibaka, and it should also help open up shots for guys like Dion Waiters, Anthony Morrow and D.J. Augustin. Kanter’s success in the post should help the Thunder reach its full potential offensively.

### Rebounding

Kanter is an excellent rebounder on both sides of the floor, and his 11 rpg with the Thunder shows that. He also had a total rebounding percentage of 19 with the Thunder, which would have put him amongst the league leaders were it for the whole season. While his time with the Thunder carries a limited sample size so far, there’s no reason to believe he can’t keep up numbers like this.

Kanter’s defensive rebounding is important because it can help the Thunder reduce second chance opportunities on defense, and it gives the Thunder some back up on the glass for when Ibaka is focusing on protecting the rim. It also allows Kanter to contribute on the defensive side of the court, an area where he struggles overall (more on that later). His offensive rebounding is extremely important as well, as it will give a Thunder offense with so many scoring options extra chances, something that should allow the team to dominate games offensively. 

Kanter is one of the better rebounders the Thunder has had, so look for him to continue his success crashing the boards.

### Defense

This should be Thunder fans’ biggest concern for the young center. Defense is really the only noticeable hole in Kanter’s game. In fact, with Kanter on the court for OKC last year, the opponent’s offensive rating was 111.7, and with him off it was 103.9. This shows that his defensive capabilities have been severely lacking up to this point.

It’s hard to say what the primary cause of this, but after watching him play, it seems like a mix of lack of effort and limited basketball IQ on the defensive side. He is a young guy, entering just his fifth year in the NBA, and is now on a great team with an exciting new coach, so for now Thunder fans should remain optimistic that he can improve on the defensive side. His offense and rebounding skills are there and still improving, and hopefully his defense will soon follow suit.

If Kanter can improve defensively, there’s really nothing keeping him from being one of the best centers in the league. That’s a big if, but only time will tell what improvements he is able to make.

Kanter should continue his overall success with the Thunder this year, and is an exciting part of an offense that features two things it’s never really had on a consistent basis: post scoring and three point shooting depth. Whether he starts or comes off the bench, look for him to be a big part of the Thunder’s success this season.
