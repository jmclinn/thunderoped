### OKC 139 - ORL 136

Wow.

Now that was a basketball game.

The Thunder kicked off their road season tonight in Orlando against a young Magic team. And it was wild.

Halloween came early when the television flashed a glimpse of Joey Crawford with the whistle. The game became even scarier as it got out of the Thunder's hands early. But even though the Magic gave it their all tonight, no one was slowing down OKC's big guns in Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook.

The Thunder started positively with Ibaka shaking his opening night rust off by splashing a jumper. Early on, the Magic showed their intentions by grinding out a quick lead. The Thunder bigs were aggressive on the glass and distributed well, and KD racked up a quick 8 points. The defense was another story, however, and for the next three quarters the Magic’s bigs of Nikola Vucevic and Tobias Harris hounded the interior.

Orlando continued to build their lead in the second quarter while the Thunder struggled to get open looks to go down. It seemed to be one of those nights where shots weren’t going to fall.

Vucevic was on fire. Sloppy offensive play and lacadasical interior defense saw the Magic jump out to a double digit lead.  Fumbled passes. More wide open looks missed. As the Magic’s lead jumped up to 15, one of the only positives was the bigs' hard work giving second chances on the offensive end. Another was Westbrook aggressibely attacking the rim and baiting the opposing guards into foul trouble. Unfortunately, shots he usually makes weren’t falling, and to add to the struggles, the half ended with Waiters bouncing a wide open corner three off the side of the backboard.  

The Thunder came out swinging in the third quarter looking to right the ship, but once again the Magic fired back. Second chance putbacks from the Magic became a regular occurrence. The team veteran, Evan Fournier, capped off a Thunder momentum killer with a 3-pointer to go up 16.  

But then the Thunder reminded me what they do so frequently. They out athlete you. For the second time in two games, new coach Billy Donovan got another test on his tactical lineup management and adjustments his former counterpart was constantly questioned on. And he passed.  

The Thunder had a big task to climb out of the 18 point deficient they found themselves in starting the fourth quarter. I had to ask myself “Did Kanter even play in the first half?” It may sounds strange, but I can understand Donavon watching his team get torched on the interior causing hesitation letting Kanter play big minutes. As the 4th quarter progressed, however, there didn't appear to be any hesitation as Kanter's stat line continued to grow. He was laying in easy an contested baskets, and challenged every rebound. He looked fantastic, and after the Thunder whittled the opponents lead to 10, Westbrook came up with a big steal and emphatic dunk to cut it to single digits. However, the Magic continued to answer everything the Thunder threw, especially by keeping plays alive with offensive rebounds. They even forced valuable time to burn off the clock by snagging a rebound on their own free throw miss.  

Down the stretch, the Donavon threw out an “unconventional” lineup. Durant and Westbrook spearheaded Augustine, Kanter, and Waiters to continue to fight. And fight. One thing became very clear: Westbrook wanted to win this game.  

So he took it over.  

There were several minutes left in the fourth (and two periods of overtime left), but Westbrook was not about to let the Thunder lose this game.  

Kevin Durant nailed a cold blooded 3 to take the lead.  

Magic guard Victor Oladipo then appeared to seal the deal with his response to go back up 3 with seconds left and no timeout remaining for the Thunder.

Russell. Freaking. Westbrook. From five feet over half court he banked it in with less than a second on the clock. Overtime.  

The Thunder go up to start overtime for the first time since their basket off the opening tip. The Thunder went back to small ball, with Adams replacing Kanter. They started strong, but soon tapered off, allowing the Magic back within reach. Roberson played spectacular defense, but Oladipo did it again, hitting an amazing shot. 2nd Overtime.

Durant was visibly tired by this point, ending the game with 53 minutes played, but he never gave up. Westbrook and Durant are too much to handle when they're fully engaged, and this rang true for the youngsters of the Orlando Magic. They stayed close however, and Steven Adams was forced to hit two clutch free throws to go up four points and keep it out of reach. As the free throw game continued, however, Westbrook missed one and it was up to the Thunder's defense to end the game. Durant came through big, blocking two consecutive 3-point attempts. 

The Thunder win. Breathe.  

Overall, it was an unexpectedly uphill, difficult battle to fight, but the Thunder are 2-0 and already showing signs of how much they want this. They know very well what one game cost them last year. Credit to Russ for inspiring that fight and taking the game over. 48 points, and just 2 rebounds shy of a triple-double. Credit to KD for being the silky, smooth self he always has been, racking up 43 points of his own.

While there were obviously flaws in the game (little to no transition offense through 3 quarters, the berating by the Magic bigs in the interior, wide open 3-point looks for Oladipo and Elfrid Payton, and a porous defensive effort for three and a half quarters) there were positive takeaways. Donavon threw lineups out on the court to give the Thunder a chance, the end of the game play to spring KD up for a 3 ball to tie the game was executed beautifully, and the fight this team showed to tell the league theyre still the Thunder and they mean business.  

Finally, a couple of quick shoutouts. Gotta give it to Brian Davis. I hate blatant homer-ism, but it's been a long offseason and it was great to hear him again. Also, Elfin Payton's basketball skills are almost as awesome as his hair. I look forward to watching his future highlights.
