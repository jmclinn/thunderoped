As with most rookies drafted onto a team fighting for a championship, the story of Cameron Payne his rookie season will be how and if he carves out a role. No one is taking Russell Westbrook's spot and D.J. Augustin defines 'solid' as a backup floor general. If Payne hopes to find minutes for himself he'll need to shake off the rookie jitters and show what he brings that Augustin can't.

He are a few things that we are keeping an eye on with Payne this season.

### Calm / Control

Rookies make mistakes. Rookie point guard mistakes stand out. When the ball is in your hands and you dribble it off your foot, or you pass behind yourself on a fast break to no one in particular, people notice. Moving past these moments and learning from them will be crucial to Payne's place on the roster this season.

He has the skills and practice operating with all the eyes on him from his time at Murray State, but both the metaphorical and literal bright lights and sounds of the NBA add their own distractions. Payne is fighting for a roster spot with a player in D.J. Augustin who has stuck in the league because he knows what he brings. He's not long and athletic. He is however, a solid shooter and passer. He fits in and does his job without standing out. Payne is athletic and a much more exciting player, but his rookie season will be best served mimicking the intangibles of Augustin.

Calm and collected play is a necessary element for a backup point guard, especially one that would be taking the floor with Enes Kanter and Dion Waiters. There's already enough offensive flash to go around. Payne's personality is anything but subtle, but for him to grab hold of a spot in this rotation he'll need to make sure he isn't shaken when staring down the Chris Pauls of the league.

### Minutes

The first look at Payne had a lot of people, myself included, locking him in to play rotation minutes by at least the All-Star break. Even if the excitement reasonably tapered off as some rookie mistakes set in, there's still ways he could receive regular minutes this season. Two point guard lineups were fairly common under Scott Brooks, and having three point guards all receiving minutes was the norm in past seasons with Westbrook, Reggie Jackson, and Derrick Fisher on the roster. If Billy Donovan sees advantages to those lineups too it could be one way Payne sees minutes without leapfrogging Augustin's spot.

One thing standing in Payne's way, however, is that Mitch McGary may deserve the minutes more. He can pass, attack, rebound, and has proven he can spark this team back to life. Depending on Collison's play and how rotations work themselves out McGary may be the better bet to crack a rotation and receive currently invisible minutes that Payne is hoping to take.

Payne will receive minutes in garbage time. If he can make the scrubs pay like Jeremy Lamb never could it could help his case. Westbrook also may sit during some back-to-backs against the bottom of the East (or the Lakers), and this frees up minutes for Payne. Barring injuries, these games may be the best chance Payne has to prove himself in an actual game situation when the points really matter.

A lot is up in the air, and the most surefire way to crack the rotation is to take Augustin's spot. That, however, will require Payne to bring something special...

### What Does He Bring?

During the Blue/White Scrimmage, Cameron Payne came out guns blazing. He was knocking down his 3-pointers and floaters, manipulating his defender where he wanted him, and hitting his man for wide open shots. Then the preseason moved out of the highschool gym and into the NBA arena and Payne came down to Earth. No one forgot the explosive edge he brought, however, and he's still a pass-first point guard that isn't just looking to get his.

For Payne to get rotation minutes he'll have to do more than show maturity and calm beyond his years and experience. They already have that player in Augustin. He'll also have to bring something beyond consistent shooting, because Augustin isn't an unknown their either. Payne is going to have to bring something special that really opens up other facets of Coach Billy Donovan's offense. If he can collapse defenses attacking the paint, beat his man off the dribble, move well off the ball, and be a reliable pest on defense then Payne has a rotation spot. It may be just one or two of these points, but he'll need to figure out where his strengths lie and how to use them effectively while also matching Augustin's strengths.

The Thunder aren't going to leave anything to chance, because they both can't afford and don't have to with the proven players on this roster. Cameron Payne has the talent to take the backup spot for his own. The only question is whether he can put it all in place do to so in this pressure cooker season.
