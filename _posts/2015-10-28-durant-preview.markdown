Kevin Durant, who is coming off a disappointing and injury riddled season, will look to return to his MVP form during the 2015-16 season.

Durant played in just 27 games last season, and though he averaged solid numbers with 25.4 points, 6.6 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game, he was unable to help the Thunder reach the playoffs due to his lingering foot injury.

This year Durant appears to be healthy and ready to help the Thunder compete for a championship again.

Here are some things to look for in Durant’s ninth NBA season:

### Health

This is clearly the biggest concern for Kevin Durant this season. Before last season’s 27 games, he had never played less than 66 games in a season. Historically he has been healthy, and Thunder fans and NBA fans in general have to hope that last year was a fluke.

Durant played well in the preseason, and he looked as though he hasn’t lost a step. All signs point to him being healthy now, and it seems as though his most recent operation was a lot more successful than the first two. 

If Durant can stay healthy, the Thunder should be one of the best teams in the NBA. 

### Leadership

Kevin Durant is just 27 years old, but behind Nick Collison and Steve Novak, he is the third most experienced player on this Thunder roster. 

Durant’s experience consists of six all-star appearances, 73 playoff games and one well-deserved MVP trophy. Needless to say, he has to be a leader on this team. 

The Thunder has a lot of young players, including Steven Adams, Andre Roberson, Dion Waiters, Cameron Payne and Mitch McGary, who could all be important parts of a Thunder championship run. These guys will need a lot of guidance, and Durant is one of the best guys to provide it. He’s really developed his game over the years to make himself more than one of the league’s top scorers, and his expertise can certainly be used to mold some of his young teammates.

Look for Durant to have a strong leadership role on this young but talented Thunder roster.

### Dominance

Durant’s last full season was his incredible 2013-14 MVP campaign, and Thunder fans should be optimistic that a healthy Durant can return to that season’s level of dominance.

When Durant is at his best, there’s only one player that can give him a run for the title of best player in the world, and the gap between him and LeBron James was certainly closing before last year’s injury. This year Durant will look to pick up where he left off.

In his 27 games last year, Durant put up good numbers and shot 51 percent from the field, 40 percent from beyond the arc and 85 percent from the free throw line. Though his season was short, these numbers put up with lingering injury problems give just a small taste of Durant’s potential. He’s capable of greatness, and the only thing that can hold him back at this point is injury.

A healthy Durant is the second best player in the world, and at times a case could be made calling him the best. This year he will look to return to his dominant MVP form.

Kevin Durant’s season last year was cut way short, and it was a shame to watch as the Thunder was unable to reach the playoffs without him. This season should end with a very different outcome, as Durant should help the Thunder contend for an NBA championship.
