####DAL 88 - OKC 100

Amongst Fox Sports Oklahoma injecting commercials in the middle of play, the Thunder also faced some preseason struggles. Rookie Cameron Payne started them off after getting the ball on a fast break, then throwing an overly nifty pass over his shoulder to.... no one. And off we go.

- When the spacing fails, where this offense goes could get interesting.

- It's still preseason, so learning the new schemes and becoming comfortable in them is key. However, I'm very interested to see how coach Billy Donovan will react when various lineups or schemes aren't working. In the moment, how flexible will he be? We were all reminded as we watched the Warriors in the playoffs last season how important flexibility is (not just roster flexibility which the Thunder also possess, but flexibility of the coaching staff) for continued success. If Donovan can utilize his pieces on the fly as well as it appears he can when having a summer and a training camp to set them up, this could be a very impactful part of the Thunder's future success.

- This new-look Thunder bench could be a massive spark as easily as it could be a potential frustration.

- Bench energy is scary good. Defense is questionable, and it looks like there could be a tendency to simply trade baskets. This energy though...

- Adam's free throws? Not as 'on fleek' as he joked they would be during media day, but the mechanics and arc look much better.

- Bad news: Ibaka still has bricks for hands. Good news: Adams' hands appear to be moving closer to 'malleable clay'.

- Brian Davis needs no preseason warmup. The guy is already in midseason form.

- Westbrook is also in 'midseason' form, which is scary to think what midseason form could actually look like.

- Cameron Payne can shoot. He's also confident, which will help him grow, but makes it endlessly more entertaining when rookie mistakes rear their head.

- Discipline was an issue under Scott Brooks, and Donovan has his work cut out for him. Everything the players have been saying is in line with them buying in. However, sloppy isolation plays have been a weak spot before, and a struggling Durant resorted back to them at times against the Mavs. Was it the result of being unable to pass out of a designed double team due to missed execution? Probably at times, but it raises an interesting question of how disciplined this team can actually be. When the offense starts to falter how will the team, and especially its stars, stick to Donovan's script and maintain discipline that it's lacked in the past.

- Dion Waiters missing layups? Check. Dion Waiters stepping back so far for a jumper that he traveled? Check. #waitersbeingwaiters

- I like Adams starting. He makes the most sense starting, and he's been effective this preseason in that role. However, I also like the look of Adams with the bench squad. What ended up being rotation adjustments due to a Kanter sprained ankle, Adams spent some time with the bench in the fourth quarter. He gave them an interior presence. When he goes straight up he creates a human wall. He also matches the energy of the second unit, and seems to give them a boost of confidence on the defensive end that they could use.

- Injury update: Ankle tweeks. Mitch McGary shook his off early in the game for some great plays as the game went on, but Enes Kanter wasn't so lucky. He came down funny and ended up in the locker room. Hope it's not serious. He was a beast down on the low block last season, and that doesn't seem to have changed.

####Eyeball Test?

**Sloppy**. Two efficient blowouts didn't lead to a third for the first televised look at the 2015-16 Thunder.
