### SAS 106 - OKC 112

Here. We. Go.

- Roberson started the game right from the tip with a great scoring hustle play. Otherwise he was an offensive potato, allowing the Spurs to switch their smaller guards (Tony Parker and Patty Mills) off of Westbrook. It added to the early struggles, and it showed why Roberson can be a detriment to the offense beyond allowing his man to help off and block passing lanes. It leaves Westbrook working against a bigger, better defender.

- The Thunder could not stop the Spurs to start. Yes, Kawhi Leonard had a career night, but the Thunder trailed the Spurs until late because the defense struggled to stop anything until they settled down and focused in the 4th quarter.

- A big part of the defensive switch was Collison. He has a way of reminding the team what tenacity they need to bring, and it changed the game after his minutes in the second half.

- Kanter didn't stick out on defense. He wasn't good and there were times when a Spur would drive right by him for an uncontested look, but he did look like he was legitimately trying. The problem? He's just so slow. He has the footwork to devastate on post-ups and the positioning to dominate the boards, but he struggles to move anywhere quickly. 

- Speaking of Kanter, he knows how to rip down a rebound and put it back up quickly. He's a beast under the basket.

- Westbrook sure was taking a lot of threes to start the game, but once he made one it tapered off. He ended the game 3-6 from distance, even nailing a critical one late in the game, catching it in the corner with under 3 seconds left on the clock.

- Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. The Thunder started the game appearing to try really hard to put the new offense into play. If, however, the Spurs defense kept them from converting on their first two passes, or the shot clock got to 16 seconds, they seemed to get bogged down. This resulted in a lot of deflected or stolen passes. Kawhi Leonard was everywhere, and the Spurs seemed to be in every single one of the Thunder's passing lanes for the majority of the game.

- Jeff Van Gundy made a good point: Starting your season off against a disciplined and very talented Spurs team is the perfect litmus test. The Thunder, and especially Coach Billy Donovan's staff, will more easily be able to see what isn't working and what to work on. Getting a win through late-game execution is big bonus points.

- In the first quarter, when Westbrook or Durant got sick of turning it over they went back to their isolation bread-and-butter. Westbrook post-ups may be a part of the Thunder's offense (because he's bigger and stronger) but Durant seemed to be pushing. As the game went on he looked better and better, going from being hounded into turnovers and blocked shots by Kawhi to catching the ball off pin downs in the flow of the offense. He still doesn't handle pesky defenders in his face, but as the game went on he seemed to work his way out of those iso struggles, using movement within the offense to aid him. A good sign.

- The Slim Reaper made an appearance. As a refresher, Slim Reaper occurrences take place when Durant unconsciously drops a dagger 3-pointer from straight away. It happened during the Thunder's run late in the fourth quarter, and it was beautiful to see.

- Also relating to confidence: Serge Ibaka struggled early. He was hesitating on everything. Maybe it was because nothing was falling for him, but as soon as he was decisive with his actions the smooth mid-range jumpers we're used to seeing began to fall.

- Russell Westbrook is so fast.

- This team is still so exciting.

- Billy Donovan fluidly, and constantly, substituted his players throughout the night. When Ibaka was struggling he sat for the next minute as Kanter got a look, before hitting the floor again. I can't quite tell if Donovan is still working through his players to see what works, or if he was simply countering what Popovich was throwing out. There's a starting and a closing lineup, but in between it's anyone's guess as to who we'll see together on a given night. I don't even think Donovan knows, which is a flexibility we're not used to seeing.

- It was weird, though, not seeing Scott Brooks storm off the bench to the middle of the court after a frustration timeout.

- The 'Bruise Bros' combo of Adams and Kanter saw the floor together on two separate occasions. Westbrook also took the floor with the bench several times. Donovan didn't seem to happy that he played Westbrook as much as he did, so it'll be interesting to see how much this happens going forward. It did, however, resume last year's effective Westbrook-Kanter connection, allowing for offensive firepower while Durant rests.

- Westbrook-to-Adams also continued over from the preseason, with Adams catching Westbrook's passes for clean finishes on back to back possessions. If it's working, why not keep trying it?

- D.J. Augustin knows what he's doing and he keeps reminding me. As time goes on I feel the likelihood of Cameron Payne breaking into the rotation dropping significantly.

- No Singler tonight. Or Mcgary.

- Dion Waiters looked good. He passed up a shot to hit an open Morrow at one point, and continued to appear comfortable working within the offense. He's also finishing games it appears. So what happens when the clock winds down in crunch-time and Waiters has the ball? Step back fadeaway! Twice. They were needed, and they went in. What if they didn't though? Post game Coach Donovan acted like this was part of the gameplan, however, and Waiters didn't seem about to argue it.

- What on this green Earth was Danny Green doing on that final attempt for the Spurs to tie or take the lead? I somehow can't see that as the out-of-bounds play that was drawn up by Popovich.

####Eyeball Test?

**A Promising Work In Progress.** It was a season opener against a very good team that never loses it's first game, so it was going to be a true test. With a sloppy start the Thunder were shown their weaknesses, but through a dynamic Russell Westbrook and solid bench play they managed to bring it all together to round into form the last 5 minutes and pull out a win.
