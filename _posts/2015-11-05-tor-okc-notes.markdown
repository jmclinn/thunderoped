### TOR 103 - OKC 98

The Thunder fall apart for a second game, turning the game over, literally, to Toronto in a sloppy, un-energetic loss. The turnovers continue to ruin spurts of very promising play and improving defense.

- After the loss to Houston, Durant said he needed to make a point to be a better leader and get his guys involved. He started the game looking to distribute, but it doesn't help how much he passes to a wide open Roberson if he refuses to shoot the ball.

- Very promising defensive effort to start. Toronto didn't get any good looks, and it seemed to fuel the offense (Scott Brooks wasn't lying all those years it turns out). You can see the potential of this team, it just hasn't been sustainable for more than a quarter at a time.

- Adams seems like he's getting better on offense every single game. He moves well in the pick-and-roll, and when he catches the ball it's usually deep in the paint and results in an easy look.

- Westbrook had 8 assists in the first quarter, and I feel like all of them were passes straight into the paint for easy looks. The offense was clicking to start this game even though the tempo was slower at times than this team wants to play at.

- When Kanter catches the ball anywhere near the basket it's going up. Usually it's a very good look, and Kanter has great moves in the post. Sometimes help comes, however, and he gets into trouble. And when more defenders get sucked in that means there's a shooter open somewhere, and it would help if Kanter's mind wasn't entirely locked on scoring.

- Singler. Good grief. 1. Fouls, fouls, fouls. 2. Absolute 0 on offense.

- So much for no turnovers. The second quarter completely erased what the first had accomplished, and despite curbing them a bit in the third the train had already derailed.

- Fouling continuously was adding to the turnovers, giving away free points. Way too many fouls.

- This team could be frustrating for a good while. They have spurts of greatness, but there's absolutely no consistency.

- At one point in the game Toronto was shooting 31% against OKC's 50%, and the Thunder were +10 on rebounds. Somehow, the Thunder were only 6 points in the lead. A perfect example of how sloppy play is making winning a much harder task.

- Morrow played over Singler (finally) in the fourth quarter. Singler was adding to the fouling epidemic, so it would have made no sense for him to see the floor, but it almost felt like that forced Donovan into playing Morrow. The lack of playing time for Morrow is very strange, especially proving what offensive spark he can bring last season and becoming a fan favorite. Donovan may be more talkative than Brooks, but what he's actually thinking is just as mysterious (and maybe more so).

- Absolutely zero urgency in the fourth quarter. Toronto should never have still been in the game, but they hung around because OKC never looked like they cared enough to put it away. They also didn't score for the last 6 minutes of the game, which is unacceptable for any team. When you've allowed the opponent to go to the line twice the number of times you have, and you turn the ball over 19 times there's no way you can get away with a scoreless finish to the game.

- Kneejerk reactions are going to start flying about now, and it's easy to see why. A learning curve will be hard for most fans to accept graciously, but when is it actually ok to start to worry? Donovan was brought in to bring some tactical skill on the offensive end that Brooks appeared to lack, but when are there too many X's and O's?

- One last thing: When Rockets guard, Kyle Lowry, passed the ball to a referee after receiving a frustrating call he was given a technical foul, because the pass was "too hard and taken as a sign of aggression." Seriously refs? Put your big boys pants on.

#Eyeball Test?

**Inconsistent and lazy.** The Thunder have failed to impose their will on games by dictating tempo or style. Instead they've allowed their opponents to control the game, and despite the superior talent in OKC the turnovers and inconsistency across the board from minute to minute has plagued this team in a very bad way.
