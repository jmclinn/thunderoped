Last season was huge for Russell Westbrook. It was his first (and hopefully last) season being the only superstar on a team. He showed the world he is more than capable of carrying an NBA team on his shoulders. With an injury depleted roster, he took the Thunder to the brink of the playoffs.

Westbrook averaged nearly a triple-double last season en route to setting career highs in scoring (28.1), rebounding (7.3), and assists (8.6) per game. He also missed a few games (15) himself after fracturing his cheek and adding "superhero" accessories to his ever expanding fashion palate.

For the Thunder to have a successful season and live up to expectations here are a few things we must see from Russell Westbrook:

### Attack

Attack, attack, attack.

The new offense relies on spacing. Keeping the court open for a player who is basically Flubber will make Westbrook even more of a threat. At any given point in the game Westbrook could be on the floor with a line up of jump shooters that will punish a defense for sagging in to stop Westbrook's penetration. Kevin Durant, Serge Ibaka, Enes Kanter, and Dion Waiters (or Kyle Singler, or Anthony Morrow, or DJ Augustin) provide four more than capable outlets to keep defenses honest.

### Distribute

It is the most written and talked about aspect of Westbrook's game - his passing. Does he do it enough? I think he does and you should too. Westbrook is not a typical point guard nor should we want him to be. He has a unique skill set. He has the ability to attack the paint like a swing man but still has the ability and awareness to make amazing passes and put his teammates in positions to score. I expect his assist numbers to go up again this season. He will not be the only creator on the court this season. This will take pressure off him to score 30+ per night and ft here will be nights when he finishes with fit around 20 and 15+ assists. He will be surrounded by the most talented roster assembled in OKC history.

### Health

Staying healthy will be necessary for every player, but specifically for Westbrook as he has picked up freak injuries twice in the last couple seasons. The torn meniscus against the Rockets in the playoffs 3 years ago ruined the playoffs that season and then was felt into the next season as well when he had to have an unexpected third surgery. Knee injuries always give me the heebie-jeebies no matter how far removed we are from the original injury. Then last season in the middle of a stretch matched only by Michael Jordan he suffered a zygomatic fracture. He essentially dented his face. Westbrook has to remain absolutely healthy this season. The Thunder need 82 regular season games from him. DJ Augustin is a capable back up, and Cameron Payne is an exciting young prospect, but neither of them are the point guard to lead this team - only Westbrook can do it.

Westbrook will put together another great season. He may not average 28 ppg again, but he will hover around 22 ppg while increasing his assists and maintaining his rebounds per game. He will finish as a top 5 MVP vote getter again.

Here's to you, Brodie. Have another great season.
