### OKC 105 - HOU 110

Oklahoma City head coach Billy Donovan experienced another milestone on his NBA journey tonight – his first loss as an NBA coach. The Thunder were muffled this evening and allowed James Harden to have his first break out game of the season. 

The Oklahoma City Thunder started slowly tonight. The first few minutes of the game were hectic, up and down the court basketball that featured several turnovers for both teams. After throwing the ball around loosely the Thunder finally settled in and took the lead. James Harden looked timid in the first quarter, waiting until there was just 6:31 left in the quarter to take his first shot of the game despite having open looks. Harden went on a quick scoring spurt though and hit several shots in the first quarter. The Thunder won the quarter by 5 points.

The second quarter looked like it was going to be more of the same. The Thunder looked comfortable and in control of the game en route to pushing the lead to 10+ points. They took an 11-point lead into halftime. 

The third quarter was not friendly to the Thunder. Russell Westbrook was limited in third quarter action after finding himself in foul trouble. He picked up 3 personal fouls in the quarter. The offense hit a roadblock and only scored 14 points in the quarter while Houston put up 28 and took the lead.

Facing losing for the first time, Russell Westbrook came out firing in the fourth quarter. He played all 12 minutes to close out the game going 5-8 and putting up 12 points in the quarter. It wasn’t enough, however, and Houston held on to win the game. 

While Harden finished with 37 points it took him a lot of shots to get there. He shot just 12-26 from the floor and 4-12 from the 3 point line. 

Kevin Durant had another good outing, scoring 29 points on 9-19 from the floor and 4-9 from deep. Russell Westbrook chipped in 25 on 10-16 shooting, and 3-6 from the arc. He nearly had a triple-double though, which is becoming a nightly threat, by dishing out 11 assists and pulling down 8 rebounds. 

Serge Ibaka had a bit of a disappointing game. He put up a double-double as well (12p, 11r), but he shot poorly and failed to assert himself early in the game when the Rockets began the game with James Harden guarding the Thunder big man. 

The thing that hurt the Thunder the most in this game was turnovers. It’s something they have struggled with early in the season. The Thunder gave up 19 turnovers against the Spurs, 20 against the Magic, and finally seemed to limit TOs against the Nuggets giving up just 13 turnovers. Tonight against the Rockets the Thunder gave up 27 turnovers. No matter how bad the competition, if you give them 24 extra chances then the game becomes very difficult. The Rockets scored 21 points off of those 24 turnovers. 

The Thunder showed that the offense still has great potential – they shot better than the Rockets – but they have to treasure the ball more. It’s unfortunate that the first Thunder loss of the season was to the struggling Rockets, but it had to come at some point. A loss on the second night of a back to back on the road is not a terrible loss. 

This team is fun to watch and they will be all season. 

Up next: Thunder vs. Toronto Raptors in OKC at 7 p.m. CST.
