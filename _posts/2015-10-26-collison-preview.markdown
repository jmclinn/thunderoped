Nick Collison is entering his 12th season in the NBA. He has spent his entire career with the same franchise and has seen the franchise go through a change in location, mascot, and color scheme. Collison has always been a fan favorite in Oklahoma City due to his hard hat, blue collar working attitude and willingness to make the hustle plays. Collison’s focus for the last several years has been defense and rebounding. It will be interesting to see what role he plays this season. 

Here are a few things to look for from Nick Collison this season:

### Hustle

Nick Collison might be the definition of a hustle player. Collison has never cracked double-digit averages in scoring during his long career. You do not stick around the league without scoring unless you are able to do a lot of other things well. Nick Collison is that player. He rebounds the ball well and will always take the extra dive to save a loose ball from going out of bounds. Nobody will soon forget the post season when it seemed like Collison was constantly bleeding from his face.

### Defense

Collison has never been a scoring machine in the NBA. The most points he averaged in a season was in the 2007-2008 NBA season – the last season in Seattle, for that matter. Last season he averaged only 4.1 ppg and shot just 41.9% from the field. These are both new lows, with his shooting performance being by far the worst of his career. But the good news is that the Thunder do not rely on Collison for his offense.

Along with countless other things that he does for the Thunder organization, Collison brings tenacious defense to the team. He has served as the resident defender when playing guys from Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol to guys like Thiago Splitter and Chris Andersen. He knows how to get under guys’ skin. It seems he passed that ability down to Steven Adams as well.

### Mentorship

With Derek Fisher settled into the head coaching role in New York City, Collison is now the resident veteran on the Thunder. The team is not a bunch of kids like it was in 2012. Guys like Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant are now seasoned players and you have to think that being around Collison helped them grow as professionals as well.

The player most like Collison on today’s roster is Mitch McGary in terms of outlook and ability and things that both players do well. However, Collison and Steven Adams have a buddy bromance that is the most fun non-basketball thing to follow for this team. Collison has taught Adams the ability to anger other big men without getting in trouble himself. Collison’s fingerprints are on the team. On a personal note – I cannot wait to hopefully one day see him healthy on the Thunder bench yet wearing a suit as a coach.
