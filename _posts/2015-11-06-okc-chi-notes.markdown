### TOR 103 - OKC 98

On national television the Thunder started strong against Chicago, but late in the game bad defense, stagnation, and a rejuvenated Derrick Rose led to another disappointing loss.

- Once again the Thunder started very strong out of the gate. Lock down defense and great movement on the offensive end without the gamble plays that lead to turnovers.

- Ibaka started 4/4 from the field, Westbrook started a 16 assist night early on with good finds, and Durant looked much stronger on defense while holding his ground against Mirotic in the post. The big three all looked engaged and ready to go.

- The Thunder also ended up in late shot clock possessions twice in the first quarter where they didn't panic. They continued to move and look for the open man, and both plays ended with a made basket before the shot clock ran out.

- The defense inside to start was good, but 3-pointers from Chicago kept them in the game early.

- Singler checked in for Durant. He continued to miss shots. I've mentioned this before (as has everyone covering the Thunder), but Singler's minutes are very confusing. Morrow would be the likely player to get Singler's minutes, but he hasn't played well in the chances he's receive either. The problem with that is, however, that the time Morrow sees on the floor is mostly without the starters where his perimeter spacing and catch and shoot abilities really stand out. He seems to be used in spots where he's a cutter. Not the best use of Morrow.

- Why can't this offense keep up it's good play for more than 8 or 9 minutes. As the first quarter ended isolation plays took over and Westbrook at one point posted up too far out 3 plays in a row.

- Durant looked like he was struggling, and not because he was missing shots. He just looked out to lunch. There were several hard drives to the basket where he was frustrated with no-calls, and maybe this turned off his drive for a while. Jimmy Butler was also destroying Durant on defense at this point in the game. Durant kept losing him off the ball as his old habit of ball watching reared its head.

- When Durant won MVP it was when he was forced to not only be the most skilled player for OKC, but also it's motor. He had to bring the energy that disappeared when Westbrook was out. It elevated his game, and he was so much more engaged. When Westbrook is on the floor Durant has a habit of receding into the background, and there's times when it's easy to forget he's even on the floor.

- After a while, Durant seemed to perk back up, and during the 3rd quarter he really stepped it up. The result? The Thunder went on an 8-2 run to tie the game.

- Kanter really is a beast on offense. He gives maximum effort and was the reason the Thunder were able to stay in the game for a lot of the fourth simply by getting offensive rebounds and second possessions. The problem was that he can't switch on defense. Adams isn't the fastest laterally, but a little bit goes a long way sometimes. Kanter was definitely trying, however, and with Adams out with back problems he did his best to contain Rose. Rose had a special kind of determination last night to finish the game though, and Brian Windhorst drumming up rumors in the press probably didn't help the Thunder.

- The defensive adjustments didn't come quickly enough to end the game. The Thunder were getting beat whether Rose shot or passed the ball, and the Bulls were able to run the exact same play multiple times to build their lead.

- The Thunder looked overall much better against Chicago. The effort was much better, and they took much better care of the ball. The team just doesn't look like it's found its 'identity' yet, and some slip-ups in coverages didn't help either. The attitude and look of this ball club seems to change every few minutes.

- Donovan also needs to get a better handle on the roster and his lineups. He's still figuring everything out, and it will definitely take time. Tape on the team can only teach you so much. It's just disconcerting to see such a consistently dominant team over the past few years trying to figure out who it is.

#Eyeball Test?

**Confusing.** The Thunder are .500, and hopefully they've learned from the good and the bad to figure out their issues. Let's just hope that addressing them one at a time doesn't take too long and this team can get clicking sooner rather than later.
