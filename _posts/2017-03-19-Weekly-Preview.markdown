# Games

## Golden State Warriors at Oklahoma City Thunder

Gametime: Monday, March 20, 2017, 7:00PM CST (TNT only)

This will be the fourth, and final, rematch of the 2016 Western Conference Finals. The Warriors have won the previous three installments. The first game between these two teams was a blowout, with the Warriors winning 122-96. The second game saw the Warriors win 121-100. The third matchup was Kevin Durant's return to Oklahoma City for his first game as a visitor in the Cheseapeake Arena. This was the closest of the games so far this season, with Golden State still managing to come away with a 130-114 win. 

There is good news for the Thunder, however. Kevin Durant will be missing this game as he recovers from a knee injury. In 3 games against his former team, Durant averaged 37.7 ppg, 9.3 rpg, and 2.7 apg. He managed these numbers on 65.6% shooting from the floor, with a devastating 62.5% from three-point range. The Thunder will rejoice in not having to game plan for Durant.

## Philadelphia 76ers at Oklahoma City Thunder

Gametime: Wednesday, March 22, 2017, 7:00PM CST (FSOK)

This game will see Jerami Grant playing against his former team. The 76ers are a young team in the long process of a rebuild. The franchise has been in rebuild mode for several years now. This year they seem to have put together a few nice runs and have shown some improvement. The team is really young and has a few good young players. Joel Embiid was a strong front runner for rookie of the year until his injury. 

The Thunder are in a tight race with the Utah Jazz for the division championship. If they want to catch the Jazz they have to take advantage of winnable games. This surely is one. However, being placed in between two western conference contenders this could be a bit of a trap game. The Thunder will need to come out and take care of business early to put Philadelphia out of the game early on.

## Oklahoma City Thunder at Houston Rockets

Gametime: Sunday, March 26, 2017, 2:30PM CST (ABC)

This game will have a lot of viewers. Sunday afternoon NBA games are some of the best ways to kill a day before the real world comes back around. This particular game will feature the two leading MVP candidates and a potential first round playoffs preview. James Harden, previously the Oklahoma City 6th man, is having by far his best season as a professional nearly averaging a triple double and has the Houston Rockets playing their best basketball in a long time. 

Houston is 2-1 versus the Thunder this season. The three games these teams have already played this season have been decided by a combined 7 points. This should be another fun game between the two teams. 

Forever and always, Thunder up!
