excerpt: "In honor of Steven Adams' return to the floor for his first preseason action here are some moments from his sitdown next to Nick Collison for a chat, and the big kiwi did not disappoint. Hightlights? Most definitely..."

The Steven Adams - Nick Collison summer bromance continued two days ago when the Thunder did a slightly New Zealand themed sitdown with the two. Also, before we get going here, all the quotes and images were taken from <a href="http://www.nba.com/thunder/news/collison_adams_1510" target="_blank">this video</a> available on the Thunder website. 

### Framing the Shot

If you've ever encuntered any of the guys on the team in real life they aren't the shortest people in the crowd, but some people are taller than others. Nick Gallo is looking short already, and it doesn't help when Adams appears to be sitting in a high chair that doesn't quite fit.

### Hair v Hair

Steve's hair is always good for a discussion, but with Nick Collison there for comparison the Kiwi deferred to the elder statesman when asked "Who has the better hair?".

Adams: The classic comb-over. Tell them about your comb in the bathroom.

Collison [reluctantly]: I'm the only player to have a comb in the bathroom...in Thunder history...

Adams: No, his is absolutely classic. Mine is just messy and gross. All over the place. I'm like the wild little brother. He's the civilized human.

### The Recurring Green Drink

I don't know what fascinated me about this, but Adams makes it great. In comparison to him it looks absurdly small, and based on his reaction I'm not quite sure he's supposed to be drinking it on camera.

But nonetheless he keeps going back in.

### Receiving Praise

When Collison says Adams is "going to be really good" and that he's already "good now" Adams has to cool off his blushing.

He got so flustered he had to be reminded where the camera was.

### Stealing the Show

Nick Collison is a smart dude with insightful answers, but what are you supposed to do when this guy is next to you?

<img src="/content/2015-10-09/9.gif" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;width:500px;max-width:100%;" />

Calm and collected isn't Adams' style unless he's getting under an opposing player's skin on the court. This series of photos all took place within about 10 seconds of each other.

I'm very curious to know who was off to Adams' right.

### Never-Ending Quotes

Ever since Adams <a href="http://newsok.com/article/5376283" target="_blank">relayed</a> his welcome to the NBA moment involving Perkins a.k.a "The Only Silverback", you have to be on quote and story alert. The man never fails to disappoint.

(on the new coaching staff)

Adams: One thing that stuck out is Monty's family. He's got a large offspring. Just a lot of kids.

(on Adams' Castaway Halloween costume)

Collison: You had a FedEx box, and didn't you pack sandwiches in the box that you could eat throughout the night?

Adams: That's a marathon. I have to be prepared. So I put the sandwiches in the FedEx box.

Collison: And he was just sneaking them the whole night.

### Bromance

You always hear Russell Westbrook is a really goofy dude, but Adams never hides it. These guys are having fun, and you have to love it.

Good to have Steven back on the floor, and here's to more laughs and bone-crushing screens.
