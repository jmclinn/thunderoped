Kyle Singler was scouted by Sam Presti during his time at Duke. He's the role player with length that Presti likes, and so he was brought over in the trade deadline unloading of Reggie Jackson last season. When he reached OKC he was asked to slip into the starting small forward spot during a dumpster fire season plagued by unrelenting injuries. Things didn't go so well.

Here are a few things we're looking for Kyle Singler to improve on this season:

### Shooting

Before reaching OKC, Singler was shooting 40 percent from the field, with nearly identical percentages from both 3- and 2-point range. It was the result of a steady climb in field goal percentage his first four seasons. Then he was traded and the floor fell out. Technically his 3-point shooting only took a 3 percent hit, but from inside the arc his shooting dropped to 28 percent. In 456 minutes, with 18 games starting, he only made 32 field goals on a team struggling dearly for offense.

The pressure of having to replace Kevin Durant would be daunting for anyone, which is understandable, and learning a new system mid-season can be tricky. It's still a fascinating drop in production, however, and one neither Singler nor the Thunder can afford this season. In the preseason his field goal percentage has risen back to above 40 percent, but that's preseason and he'll need to get even better than that to help out his team.

### Defense

Singler hasn't looked comfortable. Maybe that's just how he appears, but if there's one area he can't afford to be lost on, it's defense. He was brought in to replace Roberson one game in the preseason after Roberson picked up two quick fouls. In the ideal scenario Singler can come in and show some semblance of the same defensive tenacity, while also aiding in offensive spacing. Until Huestis is ready (if that ever happens), Singler is really the only wing defender with the size and mobility to take Roberson's place without relying on Durant to buckle down defensively while also doing what he needs to on offense.

In theory he's a great piece for the Thunder, but until he shows differently the memory of last season's unecessary and constant fouling remains scary.

### Hair, Quotes, and Stability

During this offseason Singler time travelled to the early 2000's and brought back his new hair style. He then supplied some *strange* quotes during media day. When asked why Sam Presti had been raving about him, he replied "I haven't been to any raves with [Presti]." It's an odd thing thing to say, but we'll let it all slide. Why? Because we need stability from Singler more than we need him to make any sense.

This is a big year for the franchise. There are quite a few question marks on this team, but Singler is one piece who's intended purpose is that of the glue. He seems to know and like his role, so let's just hope he follows through on that with a return to form that is stable and accountable.
