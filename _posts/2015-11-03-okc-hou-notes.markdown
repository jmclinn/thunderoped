### OKC 105 - HOU 110

A desperate Rockets team reawoke its rivalry with the Thunder, allowing OKC to get emotional and sloppy and turn over the ball 24 times on the way to its first loss of the season.

- The Rockets were embarrassed, playing at home, playing against the Thunder which Harden always seems to get up for, and the Thunder were on the second night of a back-to-back. This screamed trap game from the tip.

- Harden blocking Ibaka? That seems backward and not a good sign early in the game.

- Ibaka seemed off to start the game. A step behind on defense and clumsy on rebounds. He came to life as the game progressed, however with his fair share of blocks and rebounds to help OKC build its lead in the first half. It may be up and down for Ibaka the first few weeks of the season. He's either been really good or really off.

- Kyle "Foul Machine" Singler strikes again. Guarding Harden is foul trouble waiting to happen.

- Roberson and Singler saw time on the court together twice during the game. It seemed to work (somehow) in the first half, but that may have been more thanks to Waiters and Kanter however. When Donovan tried it again in the later part of the game it didn't work so well, and he basically said so in his post game interview.

- Kanter blocked Harden, and then caused Howard to miss! Stop the presses! He seems to be improving on defense each game. He's definitely trying.

- D.J. Augustin picked right up where he left off with great shooting. He did, however, have a few turnovers. He wasn't the only one...

- Durant's one-on-one defense was great. He was blocking and altering shots regularly. He's always had an uncanny ability to blow up a fast break, and it's good to see that hasn't changed.

- Harden and Durant were trading 3-pointers to end the half. This rivalry will always be strong as long as the main players remain in the mix, and somehow Patrick Beverly is included in that.

- The offensive rebounds in the first half were a big reason for the lead heading into the 3rd quarter. Ibaka and Adams were tearing it up under the basket, and the rebound advantage held for the Thunder the whole game. It should have been the reason the Thunder won the game, but there was another stat line that got in the way of that...

- Turnovers. Good grief. It's been sloppy since the season began, but against a skilled and fast team like the Rockets those turnovers will kill you.

- As is par for the course with these two teams, frustrations began to build about halfway through the 3rd quarter. Howard threw Westbrook down and started locking arms with everyone. Westbrook began to force himself and passes into places neither could fit. Combine that with taking a foul as Durant's shoe came off and Westbrook had to sit with his fourth foul, which spiraled the team out of control.

- The emotional control of this team is always on the brink of going over the edge of the cliff. With the raw energy Westbrook leads the team with it's not hard to see why, but some coaches have the ability to stop the bleeding by recognizing the danger, calling a timeout, and potentially switching out players. Scott Brooks learned the necessity of this at times, especially against teams like the Rockets and Clippers. Other coaches like Popovich are always up off the bench when a big momentum shot goes against their team. Billy Donovan, did no such thing last night.

- There are obvious merits for Donovan's fluid substitutions and calm game management, but sometimes a full stop is required. When the Thunder repeatedly gave the ball to the Rockets and momentum swung toward Houston in the 3rd, the Thunder continued to reel out of control. Westbrook was on the bench, and even the calming presence of Durant couldn't change things. He was continually double-teamed and forced into turnovers as well.

- Maybe Donovan didn't fully understand the history between these two teams. Maybe he thinks a turnover is a turnover and the particular circumstances surrounding that part of the game don't matter. Maybe he doesn't like to make drastic changes in lineups and style, instead trying to get his players to correct their mistakes right then and there. It'll be interesting to see what approach he takes the next time the Thunder lose their head and can't get it back attached. I don't think we'll have that long to wait.

- In other news, Westbrook seems to be inbounding the ball more often. An interesting look after Brook's preference of having a lanky shooting guard take on this responsibility almost exclusively.

- Adams had trouble chasing down shooters on the perimeter when going up against the small ball lineups Houston kept rolling out. The tradeoff for offensive rebounds and inside presence seemed to be the way to go, however, at least in the first half.

- Ibaka has always fought for rebounds with is own teammates. Kanter is even worse at it. So when both are going after a rebound there's a fairly high likelihood it's going to end up in the hands of the other team.

#Eyeball Test?

**Emotional and sloppy.** I've used the word sloppy here too much for having only played 4 games. These turnovers have to stop. 24 is too many to have a comfortable chance winning any game.
